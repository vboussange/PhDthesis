  abstract =      {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic
                   chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by
                   a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and
                   contaminate them with toxins in the field or after
                   harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of
                   major significance and hence there has been
                   significant research on broad range of analytical and
                   detection techniques that could be useful and
                   practical. Due to the variety of structures of these
                   toxins, it is impossible to use one standard
                   technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical
                   requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the
                   need for a specialist laboratory setting create
                   challenges for routine analysis. Several existing
                   analytical techniques, which offer flexible and
                   broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases
                   detection, have been discussed in this manuscript.
                   There are a number of methods used, of which many are
                   lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no
                   single technique that stands out above the rest,
                   although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly
                   linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be
                   popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample
                   pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid
                   extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction
                   (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation
                   methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid
                   chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and
                   capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as
                   ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and
                   disadvantages and future prospects of these methods
                   have been discussed.},

                   pricing formula dcpcnds on the capability of
                   investors to follow a dynamic portfolio strategy in
                   the stock that replicates the payoff structure to the
                   option. The critical assumption required for such a
                   strategy to be feasible, is that the underlying stock
                   return dynamics can be described by a stochastic

                   are gcncrated by a mixture of both continuous and

  abstract =      {Brownian motion and normal distribution have been
                   widely used in the Black–Scholes option-pricing
                   framework to model the return of assets. However, two
                   puzzles emerge from many empirical investigations:
                   the leptokurtic feature that the return distribution
                   of assets may have a higher peak and two (asymmetric)
                   heavier tails than those of the normal distribution,
                   and an empirical phenomenon called “volatility
                   smile” in option markets. To incorporate both of
                   them and to strike a balance between reality and
                   tractability, this paper proposes, for the purpose of
                   option pricing, a double exponential jump-diffusion
                   model. In particular, the model is simple enough to
                   produce analytical solutions for a variety of
                   option-pricing problems, including call and put
                   options, interest rate derivatives, and
                   path-dependent options. Equilibrium analysis and a
                   psychological interpretation of the model are also

                   applications, we are interested in continuous initial
                   data with exponential growth at infinity. Existence
                   and uniqueness of solution is obtained through
                   Perron's method, via a comparison principle; besides,
                   a first order regularity result is given. This
                   extension of the standard theory of viscosity
                   solutions allows to price derivatives in
                   jump–diffusion markets with correlated assets, even

  abstract =      {The purpose of this paper is to design an algorithm
                   for the computation of the counterparty risk which is
                   competitive in regards of a brute force "Monte-Carlo
                   of Monte-Carlo" method (with nested simulations).
                   This is achieved using marked branching diffusions
                   describing a Galton-Watson random tree. Such an
                   algorithm leads at the same time to a computation of
                   the (bilateral) counterparty risk when we use the
                   default-risky or counterparty-riskless option values

                   various socio-economic factors through their
                   influence on the natality and mortality rates, and on
                   the migration intensity and directions. In this work
                   we study an economic–demographic model which takes
                   into account the dependence of the wealth production
                   rate on the available resources. In the case of
                   nonlocal consumption of resources, the
                   homogeneous-in-space wealth–population distribution
                   is replaced by a periodic-inspace distribution for
                   which the total wealth increases. For the global
                   consumption of resources, if the wealth
                   redistribution is small enough, then the homogeneous
                   distribution is replaced by a heterogeneous one with
                   a single wealth accumulation center. Thus, economic
                   and demographic characteristics of nonlocal and
                   global economies can be quite different in comparison
                   with the local economy.},

                   Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov (SFKPP)
                   equation. We derive here an individual-based,
                   stochastic model founded on the spatial Moran process
                   where fluctuations are treated exactly. The
                   mean-field approximation of this model leads to an
                   equation that is different from the phenomenological
                   FKPP equation. At small selection pressure, the front
                   behavior can be mapped into a Brownian motion with
                   drift, the properties of which can be derived from
                   the microscopic parameters of the Moran model.
                   Finally, we generalize the model to take into account
                   dispersal kernels beyond migration to nearest
                   neighbors. We show how the effective population size
                   (which controls the noise amplitude) and the
                   diffusion coefficient can both be computed from the

                   quantitative genetic traits. We derive first-order
                   approximations for the equilibrium mean fitness (and
                   the mutation load) and determine the order of the
                   error term. For a metric trait under
                   mutation-stabilizing-selection balance our result
                   differs qualitatively from that of Crow and Kimura
                   (1964), whose analysis is based on a Gaussian
                   assumption. Our general approach also yields a
                   mathematical proof that the variance under the usual
                   mutation-stabilizing-selection model is, to first
                   order, µ/s (the house-of-cards approximation) as
                   µ/s tends to zero. This holds for arbitrary mutant
                   distributions and does not require that the
                   population mean coincide with the optimum. We show
                   how the mutant distribution determines the order of
                   the error term, and thus the accuracy of the
                   house-of-cards approximation. Upper and lower bounds
                   to the equilibrium variance are derived that deviate
                   only to second order as µ/s tends to zero. The
                   multilocus case is treated under the assumption of
                   global linkage equilibrium. {\textcopyright} 1994,

  abstract =      {We propose and develop a general approach based on
                   reaction-diffusion equations for modelling a species
                   dynamics in a realistic two-dimensional (2D)
                   landscape crossed by linear one-dimensional (1D)
                   corridors, such as roads, hedgerows or rivers. Our
                   approach is based on a hybrid “2D/1D model”, i.e,
                   a system of 2D and 1D reaction-diffusion equations
                   with homogeneous coefficients, in which each equation
                   describes the population dynamics in a given 2D or 1D
                   element of the landscape. Using the example of the
                   range expansion of the tiger mosquito Aedes
                   albopictus in France and its main highways as 1D
                   corridors, we show that the model can be fitted to
                   realistic observation data. We develop a
                   mechanistic-statistical approach, based on the
                   coupling between a model of population dynamics and a
                   probabilistic model of the observation process. This
                   allows us to bridge the gap between the data (3
                   levels of infestation, at the scale of a French
                   department) and the output of the model (population
                   densities at each point of the landscape), and to
                   estimate the model parameter values using a
                   maximum-likelihood approach. Using classical model
                   comparison criteria, we obtain a better fit and a
                   better predictive power with the 2D/1D model than
                   with a standard homogeneous reaction-diffusion model.
                   This shows the potential importance of taking into
                   account the effect of the corridors (highways in the
                   present case) on species dynamics. With regard to the
                   particular case of A. albopictus, the conclusion that
                   highways played an important role in species range
                   expansion in mainland France is consistent with
                   recent findings from the literature.},

  abstract =      {In this paper, we establish the explicit connection
                   between deterministic trait-based population-level
                   models (in the form of partial differential
                   equations) and species-level models (in the form of
                   ordinary differential equations), in the context of
                   eco-evolutionary systems. In particular, by starting
                   from a population-level model of density
                   distributions in trait space, we derive what amounts
                   to an extension of the typical models at the species
                   level known from adaptive dynamics literature, to
                   account not only for abundance and mean trait values,
                   but also explicitly for trait variances. Thus, we
                   arrive at an explicitly polymorphic model at the
                   species level. The derivations make precise the
                   relationship between the parameters in the two
                   classes of models and allow us to distinguish between
                   notions of fitness on the population and species
                   levels. Through a formal stability analysis, we see
                   that exponential growth of an eigenvalue in the trait
                   covariance matrix corresponds to a breakdown of the
                   underlying assumptions of the species-level model. In
                   biological terms, this may be interpreted as a
                   speciation event: that is, we obtain an explicit
                   notion of the blow-up of the variance of (possibly a
                   linear combination of) traits as a precursor to
                   speciation. Moreover, since evolutionary volatility
                   of the mean trait value is proportional to trait
                   variance, this provides a notion that species at the
                   cusp of speciation are also the most adaptive. We
                   illustrate these concepts and considerations using a
                   numerical simulation.},

  year =          {2022},
  abstract =      {In this paper, we introduce a new approach based on
                   distance fields to exactly impose boundary conditions
                   in physics-informed deep neural networks. The
                   challenges in satisfying Dirichlet boundary
                   conditions in meshfree and particle methods are
                   well-known. This issue is also pertinent in the
                   development of physics informed neural networks
                   (PINN) for the solution of partial differential
                   equations. We introduce geometry-aware trial
                   functions in artificial neural networks to improve
                   the training in deep learning for partial
                   differential equations. To this end, we use concepts
                   from constructive solid geometry (R-functions) and
                   generalized barycentric coordinates (mean value
                   potential fields) to construct ϕ(x), an approximate
                   distance function to the boundary of a domain in Rd.
                   To exactly impose homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
                   conditions, the trial function is taken as ϕ(x)
                   multiplied by the PINN approximation, and its
                   generalization via transfinite interpolation is used
                   to a priori satisfy inhomogeneous Dirichlet
                   (essential), Neumann (natural), and Robin boundary
                   conditions on complex geometries. In doing so, we
                   eliminate modeling error associated with the
                   satisfaction of boundary conditions in a collocation
                   method and ensure that kinematic admissibility is met
                   pointwise in a Ritz method. With this new ansatz, the
                   training for the neural network is simplified: sole
                   contribution to the loss function is from the
                   residual error at interior collocation points where
                   the governing equation is required to be satisfied.
                   Numerical solutions are computed using strong form
                   collocation and Ritz minimization. To convey the main
                   ideas and to assess the accuracy of the approach, we
                   present numerical solutions for linear and nonlinear
                   boundary-value problems over convex and nonconvex
                   polygonal domains as well as over domains with curved
                   boundaries. Benchmark problems in one dimension for
                   linear elasticity, advection-diffusion, and beam
                   bending; and in two dimensions for the steady-state
                   heat equation, Laplace equation, biharmonic equation
                   (Kirchhoff plate bending), and the nonlinear Eikonal
                   equation are considered. The construction of
                   approximate distance functions using R-functions
                   extends to higher dimensions, and we showcase its use
                   by solving a Poisson problem with homogeneous
                   Dirichlet boundary conditions over the
                   four-dimensional hypercube. The proposed approach
                   consistently outperforms a standard PINN-based
                   collocation method, which underscores the importance
                   of exactly (a priori) satisfying the boundary
                   condition when constructing a loss function in PINN.
                   This study provides a pathway for meshfree analysis
                   to be conducted on the exact geometry without domain
                   discretization.},

  abstract =      {Free boundary problems appear naturally in numerous
                   areas of mathematics, science and engineering. These
                   problems present a great computational challenge
                   because they necessitate numerical methods that can
                   yield an accurate approximation of free boundaries
                   and complex dynamic interfaces. In this work, we
                   propose a multi-network model based on

                   class of forward and inverse free boundary problems

                   the unknown solution as well as any moving boundaries
                   by two deep neural networks. Besides, we formulate a

                   equations (PDE) is a long-standing challenge in
                   numerical mathematics. In this paper, we propose a
                   novel approach to solve high-dimensional linear and
                   nonlinear PDEs defined on arbitrary domains by
                   leveraging their weak formulations. We convert the
                   problem of finding the weak solution of PDEs into an
                   operator norm minimization problem induced from the
                   weak formulation. The weak solution and the test
                   function in the weak formulation are then
                   parameterized as the primal and adversarial networks
                   respectively, which are alternately updated to
                   approximate the optimal network parameter setting.
                   Our approach, termed as the weak adversarial network
                   (WAN), is fast, stable, and completely mesh-free,
                   which is particularly suitable for high-dimensional
                   PDEs defined on irregular domains where the classical
                   numerical methods based on finite differences and
                   finite elements suffer the issues of slow
                   computation, instability and the curse of
                   dimensionality. We apply our method to a variety of
                   test problems with high-dimensional PDEs to
                   demonstrate its promising performance.},

                   gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective
                   functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order
                   moments. The method is straightforward to implement,
                   is computationally efficient, has little memory
                   requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of
                   the gradients, and is well suited for problems that
                   are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The
                   method is also appropriate for non-stationary
                   objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse
                   gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive
                   interpretations and typically require little tuning.
                   Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam
                   was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the
                   theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm
                   and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate
                   that is comparable to the best known results under
                   the online convex optimization framework. Empirical
                   results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice
                   and compares favorably to other stochastic
                   optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a
                   variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract =      {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the
                   fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs
                   changes during training, as the parameters of the
                   previous layers change. This slows down the training
                   by requiring lower learning rates and careful
                   parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously
                   hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities.
                   We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate
                   shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer
                   inputs. Our method draws its strength from making
                   normalization a part of the model architecture and
                   performing the normalization for each training
                   mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much
                   higher learning rates and be less careful about
                   initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need
                   for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image
                   classification model, Batch Normalization achieves
                   the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps,
                   and beats the original model by a significant margin.
                   Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we
                   improve upon the best published result on ImageNet
                   classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error,
                   exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

  abstract =      {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer
                   neural networks were not successfully trained, since
                   then several algorithms have been shown to
                   successfully train them, with experimental results
                   showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep
                   architectures. All these experimental results were
                   obtained with new initialization or training
                   mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand
                   better why standard gradient descent from random
                   initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural
                   networks, to better understand these recent relative
                   successes and help design better algorithms in the
                   future. We first observe the influence of the
                   non-linear activations functions. We find that the
                   logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep
                   networks with random initialization because of its
                   mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden
                   layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that
                   saturated units can move out of saturation by
                   themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the
                   plateaus sometimes seen when training neural
                   networks. We find that a new non-linearity that
                   saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we
                   study how activations and gradients vary across
                   layers and during training, with the idea that
                   training may be more difficult when the singular
                   values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are
                   far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose
                   a new initialization scheme that brings substantially
                   faster convergence.},
