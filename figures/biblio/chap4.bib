  abstract =      {For almost a century, evolutionary economics has been
                   based to a significant extent on analogies derived
                   from biology. At the same time the discipline
                   suffered from lack of analytical rigor. Recently,
                   advances in thermodynamics and information theory
                   have provided a new foundation for evolutionary
                   studies in biology and economics alike. As a result,
                   the body of studies in evolutionary economics that
                   imports concepts from thermodynamics and information
                   theory to develop new analogies is growing. This
                   paper surveys recent trends in evolutionary economics
                   at the crossroads of biology and physics, and argues
                   to supplant analogies derived from either of the two
                   disciplines. Albeit powerful means to crystallize
                   thought about evolutionary processes in economic
                   systems, analogies from biology have tended to
                   plaster over the many differences between biological
                   and economic processes that are essential to economic
                   systems. Similarly, thermodynamics and information
                   theory cannot provide a non-anthropocentric
                   evaluation of economic processes. Yet, the concepts
                   and measures available from physics can be used to
                   improve our understanding of economic evolution if
                   properly placed into the context of socioeconomic
                   processes. The paper delineates the realm for
                   non-analogy based applications of concepts from
                   physics for the assessment of economic processes in
                   light of discontinuities and emergent complexities.},

  abstract =      {Several social scientists, including 'evolutionary
                   economists', have expressed scepticism of 'biological
                   analogies' and rejected the application of
                   'Darwinism' to socio-economic evolution. Among this
                   group, some have argued that self-organisation is an
                   alternative to biological analogies or Darwinism.
                   Others have seen 'artificial selection' as an
                   alternative to natural selection in the
                   socio-economic sphere. Another objection is that
                   Darwinism excludes human intentionality. It is shown
                   that all these objections to 'biological analogies'
                   and 'Darwinism' are ungrounded. Furthermore,
                   Darwinism includes a broad theoretical framework for
                   the analysis of the evolution of all open, complex
                   systems, including socio-economic systems. Finally
                   and crucially, Darwinism also involves a basic
                   philosophical commitment to detailed, cumulative,
                   causal explanations. For these reasons, Darwinism is
                   fully relevant for economics and an adequate
                   evolutionary economics must be Darwinian, at least in
                   these fundamental senses. However, this does not
                   undermine the need for auxiliary theories and
                   explanations in the economic domain.},

                   assembly processes from community patterns. Habitat
                   filtering, competition, and biogeographical effects
                   have, for example, been inferred from signals in
                   phenotypic and phylogenetic data. The usefulness of
                   current inference techniques is, however, debated as
                   a mechanistic and causal link between process and
                   pattern is often lacking, and evolutionary processes
                   and trophic interactions are ignored. Here, we
                   revisit the current knowledge on community assembly
                   across scales and, in line with several reviews that
                   have outlined challenges associated with current
                   inference techniques, we identify a discrepancy
                   between the current paradigm of eco-evolutionary
                   community assembly and current inference techniques
                   that focus mainly on competition and habitat
                   filtering. We argue that trait-based dynamic
                   eco-evolutionary models in combination with recently
                   developed model fitting and model evaluation
                   techniques can provide avenues for more accurate,
                   reliable, and inclusive inference. To exemplify, we
                   implement a trait-based, spatially explicit
                   eco-evolutionary model and discuss steps of model
                   modification, fitting, and evaluation as an iterative
                   approach enabling inference from diverse data
                   sources. Through a case study on inference of prey
                   and predator niche width in an eco-evolutionary
                   context, we demonstrate how inclusive and mechanistic
                   approaches—eco-evolutionary modelling and
                   Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)—can enable
                   inference of assembly processes that have been
                   largely neglected by traditional techniques despite
                   the ubiquity of such processes. Much literature
                   points to the limitations of current inference
                   techniques, but concrete solutions to such
                   limitations are few. Many of the challenges
                   associated with novel inference techniques are,
                   however, already to some extent resolved in other
                   fields and thus ready to be put into action in a more
                   formal way for inferring processes of community
                   assembly from signals in various data sources.},

  abstract =      {Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are
                   used to model dynamical processes in a large number
                   of scientific fields, ranging from finance to
                   biology. In many applications standard local models
                   are not sufficient to accurately account for certain
                   non-local phenomena such as, e.g., interactions at a
                   distance. In order to properly capture these
                   phenomena non-local nonlinear PDE models are
                   frequently employed in the literature. In this
                   article we propose two numerical methods based on
                   machine learning and on Picard iterations,
                   respectively, to approximately solve non-local
                   nonlinear PDEs. The proposed machine learning-based
                   method is an extended variant of a deep
                   learning-based splitting-up type approximation method
                   previously introduced in the literature and utilizes
                   neural networks to provide approximate solutions on a
                   subset of the spatial domain of the solution. The
                   Picard iterations-based method is an extended variant
                   of the so-called full history recursive multilevel
                   Picard approximation scheme previously introduced in
                   the literature and provides an approximate solution
                   for a single point of the domain. Both methods are
                   mesh-free and allow non-local nonlinear PDEs with
                   Neumann boundary conditions to be solved in high
                   dimensions. In the two methods, the numerical
                   difficulties arising due to the dimensionality of the
                   PDEs are avoided by (i) using the correspondence
                   between the expected trajectory of reflected
                   stochastic processes and the solution of PDEs (given
                   by the Feynman-Kac formula) and by (ii) using a plain
                   vanilla Monte Carlo integration to handle the
                   non-local term. We evaluate the performance of the
                   two methods on five different PDEs arising in physics
                   and biology. In all cases, the methods yield good
                   results in up to 10 dimensions with short run times.
                   Our work extends recently developed methods to
                   overcome the curse of dimensionality in solving
                   PDEs.},

                   improved by post-processing with physics-based
                   implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the
                   best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric,
                   the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the
                   interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with
                   default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced
                   peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of
                   redocking to the native protein structure. This
                   approaches the accuracy of the recently developed

                   and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked
                   successfully. We analyze the results and find that
                   the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate
                   for extended peptides of limited size and number of

                   is argued that the interaction between technologies
                   should be viewed in a broader sense than mere
                   competition, and it is suggested that a multi-mode
                   framework provides a much richer setting for
                   assessing the interaction of two or more
                   technologies. This concept has been successfully
                   applied in biological and organizational ecology, and
                   it is shown that it can be equally useful when
                   applied to the dynamics of technological interaction.
                   It is proposed that the effect that one technology
                   has on another's growth rate be taken as a
                   classification criterion. Examples are given to
                   illustrate that three major modes of interaction
                   exist, namely pure competition, symbiosis and
                   predator-prey. In addition, the notion that the
                   interaction between technologies can in general shift
                   temporally from one mode to another is motivated. It
                   is suggested that, since the characteristics of the
                   three modes differ from one another, it is
                   appropriate to develop managerial strategies that
                   apply specifically to each of the three modes,
                   instead of just applying generic 'competition'
                   strategies. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science

                   example, the accumulation of nutrients, provision of
                   shade, amelioration of disturbance, or protection
                   from herbivores by some species can enhance the
                   performance of neighbouring species. Thus the notion
                   that the distributions and abundances of plant
                   species are independent of other species may be
                   inadequate as a theoretical underpinning for
                   understanding species coexistence and diversity. But
                   there have been no large-scale experiments designed
                   to examine the generality of positive interactions in
                   plant communities and their importance relative to

                   when other plants are nearby. In an experiment

                   with 115 species in 11 different mountain ranges, we
                   find that competition generally, but not exclusively,
                   dominates interactions at lower elevations where
                   conditions are less physically stressful. In
                   contrast, at high elevations where abiotic stress is
                   high the interactions among plants are predominantly
                   positive. Furthermore, across all high and low sites
                   positive interactions are more important at sites
                   with low temperatures in the early summer, but
                   competition prevails at warmer sites.},

                   inter-firm networks as far as they have impli-cations
                   for innovation and technological change. The studies
                   are classified according to the direction of
                   causality in network studies. In the literature, some
                   studies focus on the effect of networks, while others
                   on the origins and formation of networks. These are
                   rep-resented as a circular flow diagram of network
                   research. Circular diagram includes three themes of
                   analysis as: (1) origins of networks, (2) firm
                   performance, (3) network struc-ture, and shows the
                   relationship between these themes as observed in
                   network research. The aim of this survey is to guide
                   researchers working on inter-firm networks about the
                   theoretical and empirical results obtained up to now
                   in the field and to highlight those areas which need
                   further work. 1. Introduction During the last two
                   decades there has been a tremendous increase in
                   theoretical and empirical research on networks in the
                   economics and management literature. One of the
                   fields in which network research has grown at an
                   impressive rate is innovation and technological
                   change, as it is now accepted that innovation is most
                   effectively undertaken as a collective process in
                   which networks play a central role. The research on
                   innovation networks is evolving with contributions
                   from many disci-plines, which use different
                   approaches. Such an interdisciplinary focus has its
                   advantages as well as disadvantages. For one thing,
                   the cross fertilisation of ideas and knowledge from
                   different disciplines increases the diversity and
                   richness of the literature. On the other hand, it
                   also makes it difficult to arrive at robust and
                   general results. One can approach networks from a
                   physicist's perspective, and analyse the structure of
                   complex networks questioning whether they have some
                   general structure that are observable in different
                   domains. Or else, one can take networks from a
                   strategic management perspective, and focus on the
                   effect of inter-firm networks in different industries
                   on firm innovativeness, profitability, or some other
                   measure of performance. In another context, a
                   sociologist would be interested in analysing the
                   effect of social networks in the society and economy.

  abstract =      {The metacommunity concept is an important way to
                   think about linkages between different spatial scales
                   in ecology. Here we review current understanding
                   about this concept. We first investigate issues
                   related to its definition as a set of local
                   communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple
                   potentially interacting species. We then identify
                   four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic
                   view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view
                   and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different
                   processes of potential importance in metacommunities.
                   These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories
                   and we discuss elements related to their potential
                   future synthesis. We then use this framework to
                   discuss why the concept is useful in modifying
                   existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with
                   a number of both theoretical and empirical examples.
                   As ecologists strive to understand increasingly
                   complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple

  abstract =      {Populations that experience severe stress may avoid
                   extinction through adaptation by natural selection.
                   This process is called evolutionary rescue and has
                   been studied under different names in medicine,
                   agriculture, and conservation biology. It is a
                   component of the emerging field of eco-evolutionary
                   dynamics, which investigates how the ecological
                   attributes of species may evolve rapidly under strong
                   selection. Its distinguishing feature is to combine
                   the evolutionary concept of relative fitness with the
                   ecological concept of absolute fitness in a synthetic
                   theory of persistent adaptation. The likelihood of
                   rescue will depend both on attributes of the
                   population, particularly abundance and variation, and
                   on properties of the environment, particularly the
                   rate and severity of deterioration. Medical
                   interventions (e.g., the administration of
                   antibiotics), agricultural practices (e.g., the
                   application of pesticides), and population ecology
                   (e.g., the effects of species introductions) provide
                   numerous examples of evolutionary rescue. The general
                   theory of rescue has been tested in laboratory
                   experiments with microbes, in which experimental
                   evolution shows how different treatments affect the
                   frequency of rescue. Overall, these experiments have
                   supported the predictions of general theory: In
                   particular, abundance, variation, and dispersal have
                   pronounced and repeatable effects on the rescue of
                   populations and communities. Extending these
                   laboratory results to the field is a major task for
                   future research.},

  abstract =      {Currently there is an ongoing discussion about how
                   Darwinian concepts should be harnessed to further
                   develop economic theory. Two approaches to this
                   question, Universal Darwinism and the continuity
                   hypothesis, are presented in this paper. It is shown
                   whether abstract principles can be derived from
                   Darwin's explanatory model of biological evolution
                   that can be applied to cultural evolution.
                   Furthermore, the relation of the ontological basis of
                   biological and cultural evolution is clarified. Some
                   examples illustrate the respective potential of the
                   two approaches to serve as a starting-point for
                   theory development. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag

                   Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter's Evolutionary
                   Theory of Economic Change (1982). This seminal work
                   applied the Darwinian concepts of variation,
                   replication and selection to the evolution of firms.
                   It proposed a level of evolution, replication and
                   selection at a level higher than individuals or
                   genes, involving the replication and selection of
                   routines and institutions. Significantly, the
                   applicability or otherwise of these Darwinian
                   concepts depends on precise definitions of terms such
                   as replication and selection. The present essay
                   builds on previous work where the concepts of
                   replication (Godfrey-Smith, 2000; Aunger, 2002;
                   Hodgson, 2003b) and selection (Price, 1995; Frank,
                   1998; Knudsen, 2002b, 2003) have been refined. We
                   deploy the key concepts of 'replicator' and
                   'interactor' from the modern philosophy of biology
                   (Hull, 1981, 1988). It is shown that while habits and
                   routines can be regarded as replicators, there is a
                   case for regarding firms and similarly cohesive
                   organizations as interactors. We explore some of the
                   implications of this result and provide an important
                   component in the construction of a multiple-level
                   evolutionary theory, involving replicating units at
                   several socio-economic levels.},

                   growth forecasting tend to be extremely complex,
                   relying on a large number of variables and
                   parameters. Such complexity is not always to the
                   benefit of the accuracy of the forecast. Economic
                   complexity constitutes a framework that builds on
                   methods developed for the study of complex systems to
                   construct approaches that are less demanding than
                   standard macroeconomic ones in terms of data
                   requirements, but whose accuracy remains to be
                   systematically benchmarked. Here we develop a
                   forecasting scheme that is shown to outperform the
                   accuracy of the five-year forecast issued by the
                   International Monetary Fund (IMF) by more than 25% on
                   the available data. The model is based on effectively
                   representing economic growth as a two-dimensional
                   dynamical system, defined by GDP per capita and
                   ‘fitness', a variable computed using only publicly
                   available product-level export data. We show that
                   forecasting errors produced by the method are
                   generally predictable and are also uncorrelated to
                   IMF errors, suggesting that our method is extracting
                   information that is complementary to standard
                   approaches. We believe that our findings are of a
                   very general nature and we plan to extend our
                   validations on larger datasets in future works.},

                   markets are based on equilibrium and efficiency. Here
                   we develop an alternative based on concepts and
                   methods developed by biologists, in which the wealth
                   invested in a financial strategy is like the
                   abundance of a species. We study a toy model of a
                   market consisting of value investors, trend
                   followers, and noise traders. We show that the
                   average returns of strategies are strongly density
                   dependent; that is, they depend on the wealth
                   invested in each strategy at any given time. In the
                   absence of noise, the market would slowly evolve
                   toward an efficient equilibrium, but the statistical
                   uncertainty in profitability (which is calibrated to
                   match real markets) makes this noisy and uncertain.
                   Even in the long term, the market spends extended
                   periods of time away from perfect efficiency. We show
                   how core concepts from ecology, such as the community
                   matrix and food webs, give insight into market
                   behavior. For example, at the efficient equilibrium,
                   all three strategies have a mutualistic relationship,
                   meaning that an increase in the wealth of one
                   increases the returns of the others. The wealth
                   dynamics of the market ecosystem explain how market
                   inefficiencies spontaneously occur and gives insight
                   into the origins of excess price volatility and
                   deviations of prices from fundamental values.},

  abstract =      {During the development planning of a new product,
                   designers and entrepreneurs rely on the prediction of
                   product performance to make business investment and
                   design strategy decisions. Moore's law and the
                   logistic S-curve model help make such predictions but
                   suffer several drawbacks. In this paper,
                   Lotka–Volterra equations are used to describe the
                   interaction between a product (system technology) and
                   the components and elements (component technologies)
                   that are combined to form the product. The equations
                   are simplified by a relationship table and maturation
                   evaluation in a two-step process. The performance
                   data of the system and its components over time are
                   modeled by simplified Lotka–Volterra equations. The
                   methods developed here allow designers,
                   entrepreneurs, and policy makers to predict the
                   performances of a product and its components
                   quantitatively using the simplified Lotka–Volterra
                   equations. The methods also shed light on the extent
                   of performance impact from a specific module
                   (component technology) on a product (system
                   technology), which is valuable for identifying the
                   key features of a product and for making outsourcing
                   decisions. Smartphones are used as an example to
                   demonstrate the two-step simplification process. The
                   Lotka–Volterra model of technology evolution is
                   validated by a case study of passenger airplanes and
                   turbofan aero-engines. The case study shows that the
                   data fitting and predictive performances of
                   Lotka–Volterra equations exceed those of extant

  abstract =      {The stability analysis of socioeconomic systems has
                   been centred on answering whether small perturbations
                   when a system is in a given quantitative state will
                   push the system permanently to a different
                   quantitative state. However, typically the
                   quantitative state of socioeconomic systems is
                   subject to constant change. Therefore, a key
                   stability question that has been under-investigated
                   is how strongly the conditions of a system itself can
                   change before the system moves to a qualitatively
                   different behaviour, i.e. how structurally stable the
                   systems is. Here, we introduce a framework to
                   investigate the structural stability of socioeconomic
                   systems formed by a network of interactions among
                   agents competing for resources. We measure the
                   structural stability of the system as the range of
                   conditions in the distribution and availability of
                   resources compatible with the qualitative behaviour
                   in which all the constituent agents can be
                   self-sustained across time. To illustrate our
                   framework, we study an empirical representation of
                   the global socioeconomic system formed by countries
                   sharing and competing for multinational companies
                   used as proxy for resources.We demonstrate that the
                   structural stability of the system is inversely
                   associated with the level of competition and the
                   level of heterogeneity in the distribution of
                   resources. Importantly, we show that the qualitative
                   behaviour of the observed global socioeconomic system
                   is highly sensitive to changes in the distribution of
                   resources. We believe that this work provides a
                   methodological basis to develop sustainable
                   strategies for socioeconomic systems subject to
                   constantly changing conditions.},

                   the empirical facts, others taking a completely
                   different tack in rejecting rationality altogether.
                   One of the most promising directions is to view
                   financial markets from a biological perspective and,
                   specifically, within an evolutionary framework in

                   investors interact and evolve dynamically according
                   to the "law" of economic selection. Under this view,
                   financial agents compete and adapt, but they do not

                   over time, firms' competitive struggle is generally
                   described using autonomous Lotka-Volterra (LV)
                   models. A great limitation of autonomous LV systems
                   is that the interaction coefficients are constant,
                   and hence firms are assumed to have constant
                   competitive strategies. Also, the solutions of LV
                   models are generally unknown. To address these
                   shortcomings, we introduce a class of integrable
                   nonautonomous LV models. Our LV models present some
                   relevant advantages. First, the analytical solutions
                   of this system are known, therefore we no longer need
                   to fit the LV coefficients. Second, the analytical
                   solutions only depend on the utility functions of the
                   competing firms. Third, our model has a strong
                   connection with the logit model. As mainstream
                   economics extensively use the logit model to describe
                   market demand, our approach has solid economic
                   foundations. In the second part of the article, we
                   test the performance of our approach by studying two
                   cases in competition economics. We find that our
                   model has a better ability to describe and forecast
                   market evolution than the LV autonomous models
                   proposed in the literature.},

                   exponents of the 2 and 3-dimensional Lotka–Volterra

                   Plots of 2 and 3-dimensional Lotka–Volterra models

                   the competition known as mutualism or equivalently a
                   win-win situation where Bitcoin transaction is
                   constant while Litecoin transaction has the
                   increasing trend. The 3-dimensional GLVM analysis
                   evokes however, an increasing trend in transacting

                   Zynga. The authors{\textquoteright} valuation of
                   these firms is based on two assumptions:1) revenues
                   and profits of a social networking firm are
                   inherently linked to its user base through a direct
                   channel that has no equivalent in other sectors, and
                   2) the growth in the number of users can be
                   calibrated with standard logistic growth models,
                   which allows for reliable extrapolations of the size
                   of the business at long time horizons. Cauwels and
                   Sornette illustrate the methodology with a detailed
                   analysis of Facebook, one of the biggest of the
                   social media giants. A clear signature of a change of
                   regime, occurring in 2010 in the growth of the number
                   of users, is observed. The change of regime is a move
                   from a pure exponential behavior (a paradigm for
                   unlimited growth) to a logistic function with
                   asymptotic plateau (a paradigm for growth in
                   competition). The authors consider three different
                   scenarios: a base case, high-growth, and
                   extreme-growth scenario. Using a discount factor of
                   5\%, a profit margin of 29\% and $3.50 of revenues
                   per user per year yields a value of Facebook of $15.3
                   billion in the base case scenario, $20.2 billion in
                   the high-growth scenario, and $32.9 billion in the
                   extreme-growth scenario. According to the
                   authors{\textquoteright} methodology, this implies
                   that Facebook needs to increase its profit per user
                   before the IPO by a factor of 3 to 6 in the base case
                   scenario, 2.5 to 5 in the high-growth scenario, and
                   1.5 to 3 in the extreme-growth scenario in order to
                   meet the current, widespread high expectations. To
                   prove the wider applicability of their methodology,
                   the analysis is repeated for Groupon, the well-known

                   analysis. Customer growth will plateau. By not taking
                   this fundamental property of the growth process into

                   such as the tendency to innovate and competitive
                   advantages, vary according to firm size. Firm
                   dynamics leading to various population distributions
                   are considered as a competition-colonization scenario
                   in a spatially defined market, where firms of
                   differing sizes are treated as separate species with
                   different competition and colonization
                   characteristics. Smaller firms, given adequate
                   investment funds to innovate, are able to colonize
                   available space more quickly than larger firms, and
                   larger firms are assumed to have stronger competition
                   characteristics and are able to outcompete smaller
                   firms for occupied space. With startup and mortality
                   parameters determined empirically, firm populations
                   reach equilibria dependent on the values of the
                   capital investment parameters. The model predictions

                   the Business Dynamics Statistics database. Finally,

                   conditions affect the firm size distributions.},

  abstract =      {Ecologists have long been puzzled by the fact that
                   there are so many similar species in nature. Here we
                   show that self-organized clusters of look-a-likes may
                   emerge spontaneously from coevolution of competitors.
                   The explanation is that there are two alternative
                   ways to survive together: being sufficiently
                   different or being sufficiently similar. Using a
                   model based on classical competition theory, we
                   demonstrate a tendency for evolutionary emergence of
                   regularly spaced lumps of similar species along a
                   niche axis. Indeed, such lumpy patterns are commonly
                   observed in size distributions of organisms ranging
                   from algae, zooplankton, and beetles to birds and
                   mammals, and could not be well explained by earlier
                   theory. Our results suggest that these patterns may
                   represent self-constructed niches emerging from
                   competitive interactions. A corollary of our findings
                   is that, whereas in species-poor communities
                   sympatric speciation and invasion of open niches is
                   possible, species-saturated communities may be
                   characterized by convergent evolution and invasion by

                   competition communities that differ in resident
                   species number and average strength (and variance) of
                   species interactions. These are then invaded with
                   randomly constructed invaders drawn from the same
                   distribution as the residents. The invasion success
                   rate and the fate of the residents are determined as
                   a function of community-and species-level properties.
                   I show that the probability of colonization success
                   for an invader decreases with community size and the
                   average strength of competition (alpha). Communities
                   composed of many strongly interacting species limit
                   the invasion possibilities of most similar species.
                   These communities, even for a superior invading
                   competitor, set up a sort of "activation barrier"
                   that repels invaders when they invade at low numbers.
                   This "priority effect" for residents is not assumed a
                   priori in my description for the individual
                   population dynamics of these species; rather it
                   emerges because species-rich and strongly interacting
                   species sets have alternative stable states that tend
                   to disfavor species at low densities. These models
                   point to community-level rather than invader-level
                   properties as the strongest determinant of
                   differences in invasion success. The probability of
                   extinction for a resident species increases with
                   community size, and the probability of successful
                   colonization by the invader decreases. Thus an
                   equilibrium community size results wherein the
                   probability of a resident species' extinction just
                   balances the probability of an invader's addition.
                   Given the distribution of alpha it is now possible to
                   predict the equilibrium species number. The results
                   provide a logical framework for an
                   island-biogeographic theory in which species turnover
                   is low even in the face of persistent invasions and
                   for the protection of fragile native species from
                   invading exotics.},

                   composition because of dispersal and mortality. There

                   influences the dynamics, composition, and
                   biodiversity of communities.\n\nNonspatial models
                   predict that no more consumer species can coexist at
                   equilibrium than there are limiting resources. In
                   contrast, a similar model that includes neighborhood
                   competition and random dispersal among sites predicts
                   stable coexistence of a potentially unlimited number
                   of species on a single resource. Coexistence cocurs
                   because species with sufficiently high dispersal
                   rates persist in sites not occupied by surperior
                   competitors. Coexistence requires limiting similarity
                   and two-way or three-way interspecific trade-offs
                   among competitive ability, colonization ability and

                   requisite trade-offs in colonization, competition,
                   and longevity, (2) by addition of propagules to
                   determine if local species abundances are limited by

                   involved in oceanic plankton dynamics is crucial for
                   the determination of energy and mass flux through an
                   ecosystem and for the estimation of biogeochemical
                   element cycling. Many planktonic ecosystem models
                   were developed to resolve major processes so that
                   flux estimates can be derived from numerical
                   simulations. These results depend on the type and
                   number of parameterizations incorporated as model
                   equations. Furthermore, the values assigned to
                   respective parameters specify a model's solution.
                   Representative model results are those that can
                   explain data; therefore, data assimilation methods
                   are utilized to yield optimal estimates of parameter
                   values while fitting model results to match data.
                   Central difficulties are (1) planktonic ecosystem
                   models are imperfect and (2) data are often too
                   sparse to constrain all model parameters. In this
                   review we explore how problems in parameter
                   identification are approached in marine planktonic
                   ecosystem modelling. We provide background
                   information about model uncertainties and estimation
                   methods, and how these are considered for assessing
                   misfits between observations and model results. We
                   explain differences in evaluating uncertainties in
                   parameter estimation, thereby also discussing issues
                   of parameter identifiability. Aspects of model
                   complexity are addressed and we describe how results
                   from cross-validation studies provide much insight in
                   this respect. Moreover, approaches are discussed that
                   consider time- and space-dependent parameter values.
                   We further discuss the use of dynamical/statistical
                   emulator approaches, and we elucidate issues of
                   parameter identification in global biogeochemical
                   models. Our review discloses many facets of parameter
                   identification, as we found many commonalities
                   between the objectives of different approaches, but
                   scientific insight differed between studies. To learn
                   more from results of planktonic ecosystem models we
                   recommend finding a good balance in the level of
                   sophistication between mechanistic modelling and
                   statistical data assimilation treatment for parameter
                   estimation.},

                   the domain of applicability of most small molecule
                   and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test
                   the small molecule flexible ligand docking program
                   Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides
                   and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy
                   by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible
                   polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was
                   improved by post-processing with physics-based
                   implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the
                   best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric,
                   the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the
                   interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with
                   default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced
                   peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of
                   redocking to the native protein structure. This
                   approaches the accuracy of the recently developed
                   Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19
                   peptides) while being over 100 times faster.
                   Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases
                   where an unbound receptor structure was available,
                   and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked
                   successfully. We analyze the results and find that
                   the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate
                   for extended peptides of limited size and number of
                   formal charges, defining a domain of applicability

                   gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective
                   functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order
                   moments. The method is straightforward to implement,
                   is computationally efficient, has little memory
                   requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of
                   the gradients, and is well suited for problems that
                   are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The
                   method is also appropriate for non-stationary
                   objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse
                   gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive
                   interpretations and typically require little tuning.
                   Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam
                   was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the
                   theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm
                   and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate
                   that is comparable to the best known results under
                   the online convex optimization framework. Empirical
                   results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice
                   and compares favorably to other stochastic
                   optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a
                   variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

                   sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics
                   algorithm, the sub-selection of candidate models near
                   the Pareto frontier allows feasible computation of

                   species interactions across trophic levels, for
                   example, pollination and biological pest control.
                   Despite this, our understanding of ecosystem function
                   in multitrophic communities is poor, and research has
                   been limited to either manipulation in small
                   communities or statistical descriptions in larger
                   ones. Recent advances in food web ecology may allow
                   us to overcome the trade-off between mechanistic
                   insight and ecological realism. Molecular tools now
                   simplify the detection of feeding interactions, and
                   trait-based approaches allow the application of
                   dynamic food web models to real ecosystems. We
                   performed the first test of an allometric food web
                   model's ability to replicate temporally nonaggregated
                   abundance data from the field and to provide
                   mechanistic insight into the function of predation.
                   We aimed to reproduce and explore the drivers of the
                   population dynamics of the aphid herbivore
                   Rhopalosiphum padi observed in ten Swedish barley
                   fields. We used a dynamic food web model, taking
                   observed interactions and abundances of predators and
                   alternative prey as input data, allowing us to
                   examine the role of predation in aphid population
                   control. The inverse problem methods were used for
                   simultaneous model fit optimization and model
                   parameterization. The model captured >70% of the
                   variation in aphid abundance in five of ten fields,
                   supporting the model-embodied hypothesis that body
                   size can be an important determinant of predation in
                   the arthropod community. We further demonstrate how
                   in-depth model analysis can disentangle the likely
                   drivers of function, such as the community's
                   abundance and trait composition. Analysing the
                   variability in model performance revealed knowledge
                   gaps, such as the source of episodic aphid mortality,
                   and general method development needs that, if
                   addressed, would further increase model success and
                   enable stronger inference about ecosystem function.
                   The results demonstrate that confronting dynamic food
                   web models with abundance data from the field is a
                   viable approach to evaluate ecological theory and to
                   aid our understanding of function in real ecosystems.
                   However, to realize the full potential of food web
                   models, in ecosystem function research and beyond,
                   trait-based parameterization must be refined and
                   extended to include more traits than body size.},

                   nature. The framework of successional theory needs to
                   be examined as a basis for resolving man's present
                   environmental crisis. Most ideas pertaining to the
                   development of ecological systems are based on
                   descriptive data obtained by observing changes in
                   biotic communities over long periods, or on highly
                   theoretical assumptions; very few of the generally
                   accepterd hypotheses have been tested experimentally.
                   Some of the confusion, vagueness and lack of
                   experimental work in this area stems from the
                   tendency of ecologiusts to regard "succession" as a
                   single straitforward idea; in actual fact, it entails
                   an interacting complex of processes, some of which
                   counteract one another.},

  abstract =      {Most studies of plant-animal mutualisms involve a
                   small number of species. There is almost no
                   information on the structural organization of
                   species-rich mutualistic networks despite its
                   potential importance for the maintenance of
                   diversity. Here we analyze 52 mutualistic networks
                   and show that they are highly nested; that is, the
                   more specialist species interact only with proper
                   subsets of those species interacting with the more
                   generalists. This assembly pattern generates highly
                   asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community
                   cohesively around a central core of interactions.
                   Thus, mutualistic networks are neither randomly
                   assembled nor organized in compartments arising from
                   tight, parallel specialization. Furthermore,
                   nestedness increases with the complexity (number of
                   interactions) of the network: for a given number of
                   species, communities with more interactions are
                   significantly more nested. Our results indicate a
                   nonrandom pattern of community organization that may
                   be relevant for our understanding of the organization
                   and persistence of biodiversity.},

  abstract =      {In economic systems, the mix of products that
                   countries make or export has been shown to be a
                   strong leading indicator of economic growth. Hence,
                   methods to characterize and predict the structure of
                   the network connecting countries to the products that
                   they export are relevant for understanding the
                   dynamics of economic development. Here we study the
                   presence and absence of industries in international
                   and domestic economies and show that these networks
                   are significantly nested. This means that the less
                   filled rows and columns of these networks' adjacency
                   matrices tend to be subsets of the fuller rows and
                   columns. Moreover, we show that their nestedness
                   remains constant over time and that it is sustained
                   by both, a bias for industries that deviate from the
                   networks' nestedness to disappear, and a bias for the
                   industries that are missing according to nestedness
                   to appear. This makes the appearance and
                   disappearance of individual industries in each
                   location predictable. We interpret the high level of
                   nestedness observed in these networks in the context
                   of the neutral model of development introduced by
                   Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009). We show that the model
                   can reproduce the high level of nestedness observed
                   in these networks only when we assume a high level of
                   heterogeneity in the distribution of capabilities
                   available in countries and required by products. In
                   the context of the neutral model, this implies that
                   the high level of nestedness observed in these
                   economic networks emerges as a combination of both,
                   the complementarity of inputs and heterogeneity in
                   the number of capabilities available in countries and
                   required by products. The stability of nestedness in
                   industrial ecosystems, and the predictability implied
                   by it, demonstrates the importance of the study of
                   network properties in the evolution of economic
                   networks.},
