# Thesis structure

<!-- in this file we propose different structure to compile the documents -->

## Version 1 : Chronological
- Differentiation in graphs
- Scientific machine learning
- Econobio

## Version 2 : methods / applications
- scientific machine learning for confronting models to data
- eco evolutionary processes in cas

## Version 3: Loic
- differentiation in graphs: all the theoretical tool panels
- scientific machine learning for ODE : simple models to be calibrated against data
- econobio : applications
- going further: highly dimensional pdes as complex models for representing structured populations
-
