- Biological and economic systems are complex adaptive systems, composed of heterogeneous organisms and agents interacting in nonlinear ways and experiencing evolutionary processes.
- The processes of interaction and evolution act at different organizational scales, from genes to ecosystems, and from organizational routines to economies, and result in invariant patterns. This is the case of large-scale spatial patterns of biodiversity and differences in economic growth across countries.
- These invariant patterns provide opportunities to underpin organizational principles in biological and economic systems, despite the astonishing complexity of the processes and feedback mechanisms involved.
- In biological systems,
