# Conclusion

## Limits

- obtaining supportive evidence from experiments does prove hypothesis in a logical sense - it only means that you have failed to disprove your hypothesis.
- “laws of nature,” including those listed previously, are no more
than well-tested hypotheses at best \cite{Sayama}
- all science can do is just build models of nature. All of the laws of nature
mentioned earlier are also models, not scientific facts, strictly speaking. This is something every single person working on scientific research should always keep in mind. I

## Perspectives
- Changing the parsimonious view of dynamical models
  - Rather than counting the number of parameters, it would be interesting to account for the complexity of the dynamical behavior a model can produce.
    - Simple chaotic models can be fitted to any type of data \cite{Boue2019}
    - This has beeen proposed by \cite{Boschetti2008}
- Levin: In the metaphor of Ralph Gomory [21], the central problem is to develop an appropriate statistical mechanics that allows one to sepa- rate the knowable unknown from the truly unknowable.
