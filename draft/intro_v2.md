# Thesis intro

## Complex adaptive systems
**The dynamics of ecosystems and economic systems is the result of the interaction of heterogeneous entities structured at different levels of organizations. Those entities interact in nonlinear ways and experience evolutionary processes. The effect of such forces, acting upon individual entities at the microscopic level, are propagated at the macroscopic level, and fed back to the microscopic level. These interactions across scales make those systems difficult to understand and predict.**
