What a journey!
% 
Four years ago, I have decided to embark on a ship to live a big adventure.
% 
Worringly lacking sailing experience, I still envisioned a voyage in unknown seas, at the crossroads between biology, economics, and applied mathematics.
% 
I wanted to experience storms and dangers because, as Alfred Maufray said, "\textit{À vaincre sans périls, on triomphe sans joie}" \citep{maufrais1997aventures}.
% 
But honestly, I was not expecting so much!
% 
Here are some words that cannot express all the gratitude I have towards these people who supported me all along this journey, and without whom I could not have made it safe back home.

I thank my supervisor, Loïc Pellissier, who made this expedition possible by providing the necessary ingredients: a boat and a map. Loïc, thank you so much for allowing me the freedom to draw the exact route, while kindly indicating me the North when I was lost.
% 
I thank Arnulf Jentzen for guiding me through the strange sea of applied mathematics, besides my lack of mathematical rigor. Arnulf, thank you for your forgiveness and patience, I have come a long way!
% 
I thank Didier Sornette for welcoming ideas with enthousiasm, and give it substance with his experience and knowledge.
% 
I thank Thomas Poulet for his mentorship through ought the voyage. Thomas, you were the one who taught the most important rudiments required to sail! 
% 
I thank Heike Lischke for her help in crucial times.
% 
I thank Sebastian Becker and Pau Vilimelis Aceituno for their goodness, skills and precious hands.
% 
I thank all my friends and colleagues from the Landscape Ecology group. Special thanks to Giulia Donati and Camille Pitteloud for introducing me to Zürich, and to the world of research. The times when you were here in the lab were the most delightful moments of the voyage.
% 
Special thanks to Charles de Novaes and Benjamin Flück, who respectively introduced me to Julia and helped me with amazing efficiency when I was about to throw my computer in the bin (which I eventually did).
% 
Special thanks to Conor Waldock, Marc Grünig and Alex Skeels for their help and kindness. You guys always had the right advice at the right time!

I am also thankful to all of my wonderful friends, whose company gave me precious half-times to further continue the journey.
% 
Special thanks to Théo Lafitte, Matthieu Demolin, Yoann Roncajolo, Diego Parlange and Luc Thiebaut for sharing wine, waves and delicious stupidity. This saying by Serge Gainsbourg has never been so meaningful than with you: "\textit{La connerie, c'est la décontraction de l'intelligence}".
% 
Special thanks to Simon Ducroz, Valentin Mathieu, Mathieu Duthoit, Baptiste Le Maire, Guillaume Chabert and Alexandre Martineau for sharing moments of pure beauty, friendship and happiness in the high alpine.
% 
Special thanks to my riding buddies Morgan Guening and Daniel Grogg for introducing me to enduro mountainbiking, and for sharing sheer moments of joy and adrenaline. Life in Zürich would have been very different without you guys! 
% 
Special thanks to my climbing buddies Anita Herger and Jonas von Wartburg, for fabulous moments of verticality, bliss and philosophy, and the German and climbing sessions on Tuesday evenings.

A massive thank-you to my family for their support. Sabine, Clémentine and Marc, thank you so much for always having been here with me. 
% 
And last but not least, I thank Flora for making every second of this life worth remembering.
% 
I'll never be as good of a sailor as you are, but we'll become two captains very soon.
