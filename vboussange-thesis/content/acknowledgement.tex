What a journey! Looking four years back, I was this unrealistic young engineer with good recard track at my uni. A PhD should be like the rest, like an exam: I'll be given a question, and i'll find the correct analytical formula. 
%
I was pretty confident, aiming at revolutionizing Biology. It is only after a few months that I realised life ain't so easy.
% 
My first failure: the geotrait. There is not a single answer as at uni, but multiple paths, which might with very low probability converge to an approximate answer and most of all new questions.
% 
This adventure would not have been successful / I could not have escaped the pitfals of the PhD without the help of some wonderful people, whome I shall thank.
% 
% Friends
I thank Giulia and Camille for introducing me to Zürich, and to the world of research. The time where the were in the lab was the most beautiful moments in my PhD.

I thank Morgan for his support and mentoring. I thank the same guy and Daniel for being my riding buddies, with whom I could progress on the trails when I was moving in the reverse direction with the PhD.
% 
I thank Jonas for the Tuesday climbing sesh, who allowed me to gain elevation while I was dipping into the valley of shit.

% 
% Supervisors
I thank Heike Lischke for her help.

I thank Thomas Poulet for his mentorship informal during all my PhD, and having me encouraged to pursue a PhD after the master thesis.
% 
I thank Arnulf Jentzen for giving me his trust and his enthusiasm and interest for the project I proposed him. 
% 
I thank Loïc Pellissier for his enthusiasm and open mindedness, and all the freedom he allowed me during the PhD. Giving me the opportunity and freedom to tackle questions, start risky projects.

I thank my parents, and my sister, for supporting me.
