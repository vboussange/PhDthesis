What a journey! Looking four years back, I was this unrealistic young engineer with good recard track at my uni. A PhD should be like the rest, like an exam: I'll be given a question, and i'll find the correct analytical formula.

I was pretty confident, aiming at revolutionizing Biology. It is only after a few months that I realised life ain't so easy.

My first failure: the geotrait. There is not a single answer as at uni, but multiple paths, which might with very low probability to convergence to an approximate answer and most of all a new question.

I thank my parents, my sister, my friends, and my beloved Flora.
