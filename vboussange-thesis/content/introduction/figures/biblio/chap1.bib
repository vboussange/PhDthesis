  abstract =      {Mountain regions are unusually biodiverse, with rich
                   aggregations of small-ranged species that form
                   centers of endemism. Mountains play an array of roles
                   for Earth's biodiversity and affect neighboring
                   lowlands through biotic interchange, changes in
                   regional climate, and nutrient runoff. The high
                   biodiversity of certain mountains reflects the
                   interplay of multiple evolutionary mechanisms:
                   enhanced speciation rates with distinct opportunities
                   for coexistence and persistence of lineages, shaped
                   by long-term climatic changes interacting with
                   topographically dynamic landscapes. High diversity in
                   most tropical mountains is tightly linked to bedrock
                   geology—notably, areas comprising mafic and
                   ultramafic lithologies, rock types rich in magnesium
                   and poor in phosphate that present special
                   requirements for plant physiology. Mountain
                   biodiversity bears the signature of deep-time
                   evolutionary and ecological processes, a history well
                   worth preserving.},

                   historical processes is central for understanding
                   biodiversity patterns. While several studies show
                   that past conditions can partly explain the current
                   biodiversity patterns, the role of history remains
                   elusive. We reconstructed palaeo-drainage basins
                   under lower sea level conditions (Last Glacial
                   Maximum) to test whether the historical connectivity
                   between basins left an imprint on the global patterns
                   of freshwater fish biodiversity. After controlling
                   for contemporary and past environmental conditions,
                   we found that palaeo-connected basins displayed
                   greater species richness but lower levels of endemism
                   and beta diversity than did palaeo-disconnected
                   basins. Palaeo-connected basins exhibited shallower
                   distance decay of compositional similarity,
                   suggesting that palaeo-river connections favoured the
                   exchange of fish species. Finally, we found that a
                   longer period of palaeo-connection resulted in lower
                   levels of beta diversity. These findings reveal the
                   first unambiguous results of the role played by
                   history in explaining the global contemporary

                   These ANNs are the most recent development in
                   computer-aided identification and are very different
                   from conventional techniques. Here we use the
                   potential of ANNs to deal with some of the persistent
                   fuzzy and nonlinear problems that confound classical
                   statistical methods for species diversity prediction.
                   We show that riverine fish diversity patterns on a
                   global scale can be successfully predicted by
                   geographical patterns in local river conditions.
                   Nonlinear relationships, fitted by ANN methods,
                   adequately describe the data, with up to 93 per cent
                   of the total variation in species richness being

                   theory and contrast with those from a recent study on
                   North American mammal species, but, more
                   interestingly, they demonstrate the applicability of

                   understanding biodiversity patterns across space and
                   time. In the past, the two disciplines have addressed
                   this question mainly with correlative approaches,
                   despite frequent calls for more mechanistic
                   explanations. Recent advances in computational power,
                   theoretical understanding, and statistical tools are,
                   however, currently facilitating the development of
                   more system-oriented, mechanistic models. We review
                   these models, identify different model types and
                   theoretical frameworks, compare their processes and
                   properties, and summarize emergent findings. We show
                   that ecological (physiology, demographics, dispersal,
                   biotic interactions) and evolutionary processes, as
                   well as environmental and human-induced drivers, are
                   increasingly modelled mechanistically; and that new
                   insights into biodiversity dynamics emerge from these
                   models. Yet, substantial challenges still lie ahead
                   for this young research field. Among these, we
                   identify scaling, calibration, validation, and
                   balancing complexity as pressing issues. Moreover,
                   particular process combinations are still
                   understudied, and so far models tend to be developed
                   for specific applications. Future work should aim at
                   developing more flexible and modular models that not
                   only allow different ecological theories to be
                   expressed and contrasted, but which are also built
                   for tight integration with all macroecological data
                   sources. Moving the field towards such a ‘systems
                   macroecology' will test and improve our understanding
                   of the causal pathways through which eco-evolutionary

                   approach based on the technique of spatial moment
                   equations. I first provide a mathematical
                   underpinning to the derivation of equations for the
                   densities of various spatial configurations in
                   network-based models. I then show how this spatial

  abstract =      {Genetic diversity is important for the maintenance of
                   the viability and the evolutionary or adaptive
                   potential of populations and species. However, there
                   are two principal types of genetic diversity:
                   adaptive and neutral - a fact widely neglected by
                   non-specialists. We introduce these two types of
                   genetic diversity and critically point to their
                   potential uses and misuses in population or landscape
                   genetic studies. First, most molecular-genetic
                   laboratory techniques analyse neutral genetic
                   variation. This means that the gene variants detected
                   do not have any direct effect on fitness. This type
                   of genetic variation is thus selectively neutral and
                   tells us nothing about the adaptive or evolutionary
                   potential of a population or a species. Nevertheless,
                   neutral genetic markers have great potential for
                   investigating processes such as gene flow, migration
                   or dispersal. Hence, they allow us to empirically
                   test the functional relevance of spatial indices such
                   as connectivity used in landscape ecology. Second,
                   adaptive genetic variation, i.e. genetic variation
                   under natural selection, is analysed in quantitative
                   genetic experiments under controlled and uniform
                   environmental conditions. Unfortunately, the genetic
                   variation (i.e. heritability) and population
                   differentiation at quantitative, adaptive traits is
                   not directly linked with neutral genetic diversity or
                   differentiation. Thus, neutral genetic data cannot
                   serve as a surrogate of adaptive genetic data. In
                   summary, neutral genetic diversity is well suited for
                   the study of processes within landscapes such as gene
                   flow, while the evolutionary or adaptive potential of
                   populations or species has to be assessed in

                   problem. It is believed that many species originated
                   through allopatric diver- gence, where new species
                   arise from geographically isolated populations of the
                   same ancestral species1–3 . In contrast, the
                   possibility of sympatric speciation (in which new
                   species arise without geographical isolation) has
                   often been dismissed, partly because of theoretical

                   present a model that integrates a novel combination
                   of different features and show that sympatric
                   speciation is a likely outcome of competition for
                   resources. We use multilocus genetics to describe
                   sexual repro- duction in an individual-based model,
                   and we consider the evolution of assortative mating
                   (where individuals mate prefer- entially with like
                   individuals) depending either on an ecological
                   character affecting resource use or on a selectively
                   neutral marker trait. In both cases, evolution of
                   assortative mating often leads to reproductive
                   isolation between ecologically diverging subpopula-
                   tions.When assortative mating depends on a marker
                   trait, and is therefore not directly linked to
                   resource competition, speciation occurs when genetic
                   drift breaks the linkage equilibrium between the
                   marker and the ecological trait. Our theory conforms
                   well with mounting empirical evidence for the
                   sympatric origin of many species},

                   dominated by a neutralist view, according to which
                   gene flow and drift are the main forces driving
                   population genetic structure in nature. The
                   neutralist view in essence describes a process of
                   isolation by dispersal limitation (IBDL) that
                   generally leads to a pattern of isolation by distance
                   (IBD). Recently, however, conceptual frameworks have
                   been put forward that view local genetic adaptation
                   as an important driver of population genetic
                   structure. Isolation by adaptation (IBA) and
                   monopolization (M) posit that gene flow among natural
                   populations is reduced as a consequence of local
                   genetic adaptation. IBA stresses that effective gene
                   flow is reduced among habitats that show dissimilar
                   ecological characteristics, leading to a pattern of
                   isolation by environment. In monopolization, local
                   genetic adaptation of initial colonizing genotypes
                   results in a reduction in gene flow that fosters the
                   persistence of founder effects. Here, we relate these
                   different processes driving landscape genetic
                   structure to patterns of IBD and isolation by
                   environment (IBE). We propose a method to detect
                   whether IBDL, IBA and M shape genetic differentiation
                   in natural landscapes by studying patterns of
                   variation at neutral and non-neutral markers as well
                   as at ecologically relevant traits. Finally, we
                   reinterpret a representative number of studies from
                   the recent literature by associating patterns to
                   processes and identify patterns associated with local
                   genetic adaptation to be as common as IBDL in
                   structuring regional genetic variation of populations
                   in the wild. Our results point to the importance of
                   quantifying environmental gradients and incorporating
                   ecology in the analysis of population genetics.

  abstract =      {1. Dispersal and gene flow can have a variety of
                   interacting effects on evolution. These effects can
                   either promote or constrain adaptive divergence
                   through either genetic or demographic routes. The
                   relative importance of these effects is unknown
                   because few attempts have been made to conceptually
                   integrate and test them. 2. We draw a broad
                   distinction between situations with vs. without
                   strong coevolutionary dynamics. This distinction is
                   important because the adaptive peak for a given
                   population is more mobile in the former than in the
                   latter. This difference makes ongoing evolutionary
                   potential more important in the presence of strong
                   coevolutionary dynamics than in their absence. 3. We
                   advance a conceptual integration of the various
                   effects of gene flow and dispersal on adaptive
                   divergence. In line with other authors, but not
                   necessarily for the same reasons, we suggest that an
                   intermediate level of gene flow will allow the
                   greatest adaptive divergence. 4. When dispersal is
                   quite low, we predict that an increase will have
                   positive effects on adaptive divergence, owing to
                   genetic/demographic rescue and 'reinforcement.' The
                   rescue effect may be more important in small
                   populations and in homogeneous environments. The
                   reinforcement effect may be more common in large
                   populations and in heterogeneous environments. 5.
                   Once a certain level of dispersal is reached, we
                   predict that a further increase may have negative
                   effects on adaptive divergence. These effects may
                   arise if carrying capacity is exceeded or maladaptive
                   genes are introduced. 6. Many additional effects
                   remain to be integrated into this framework, and
                   doing so may yield novel insights into the factors
                   influencing evolution on ecological time-scales.

                   for management, conservation and biological control
                   is how changing connectivity affects the persistence
                   and dynamics of interacting species. Researchers in
                   many disciplines have used large systems of coupled
                   oscillators to model the behaviour of a diverse array
                   of fluctuating systems in nature. In the well-studied
                   regime of weak coupling, synchronization is favoured
                   by increases in coupling strength and large-scale
                   network structures (for example 'small worlds') that
                   produce short cuts and clustering. Here we show that,
                   by contrast, randomizing the structure of dispersal
                   networks in a model of predators and prey tends to
                   favour asynchrony and prolonged transient dynamics,

                   population fluctuations. Our results focus on

                   networks with its underlying metapopulation

                   affected by the architecture of the spatial network,
                   although this effect depends on demographic
                   parameters here represented by the
                   extinction-to-colonization ratio (e/. c). Thus, for
                   moderate to large e/. c-values, regional abundance
                   grows with the heterogeneity of the network, with
                   uniform or random networks having the lowest regional
                   abundances, and scale-free networks having the
                   largest abundance. However, the ranking is reversed
                   for low extinction probabilities, with heterogeneous
                   networks showing the lowest relative abundance. We
                   further explore the mechanisms underlying such

                   understanding metapopulation abundance, and serve to

                   such as dendrites like river networks, can explain
                   observed features of biodiversity, but direct

                   dispersal in isotropic lattice landscapes homogenizes

                   habitat patches. The consequences of habitat loss for
                   ecosystem functioning depend, in part, on how these
                   changes in connectivity alter the spatial insurance
                   effects of biodiversity. Spatial insurance is the
                   maintenance of biodiversity and stable ecosystem
                   functioning in changing environments that occurs when
                   species are able to move between local habitat
                   patches in order to track conditions to which they
                   are adapted. Spatial insurance requires a combination
                   of species sorting dynamics, which allow species to
                   disperse to habitats where they are productive, and
                   mass effect dynamics, where dispersal allows species
                   to persist in marginal habitats where environmental
                   conditions do not support growth. Here we use a
                   spatially explicit metacommunity model to show that
                   the relative contribution of species sorting and mass
                   effects to spatial insurance changes with the rate of
                   dispersal. We then simulate different sequences of
                   habitat loss by removing habitat patches based on
                   their betweenness centrality (the degree to which a
                   patch serves as a connection between other patches in
                   the metacommunity). We demonstrate that the sequence
                   of habitat loss has a large, non-linear impact on
                   diversity, ecosystem functioning and stability.
                   Spatial insurance is lost because habitat
                   fragmentation impedes species sorting, while
                   promoting mass effects and dispersal limitation. We
                   find that species sorting dynamics, and thus spatial
                   insurance, are most robust to the removal of habitat
                   patches with low betweenness centrality. These
                   findings advance our understanding of how habitat
                   connectivity facilitates the maintenance of
                   biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and may prove
                   useful for the design of habitat networks.},

                   identifying population structures that augment the

                   these amplifiers of natural selection typically

                   we design population structures that substantially

                   and community drift. Here, we advance the spatially
                   explicit neutral model by representing the
                   metacommunity as a network of smaller communities.
                   Analytic theory is presented for a set of equilibrium
                   diversity patterns in networks of communities,
                   facilitating the exploration of parameter space not
                   accessible by simulation. We use this theory to
                   evaluate how the basic properties of a metacommunity
                   - connectivity, size, and speciation rate - determine
                   overall metacommunity $\gamma$-diversity, and how
                   that is partitioned into $\alpha$- and
                   $\beta$-components. We find spatial structure can
                   increase $\gamma$-diversity relative to a well-mixed

                   is related to the ratio of migration and speciation

                   diversity. Recent advances in metacommunity ecology,
                   and neutral theory in particular, highlight the
                   importance of dispersal processes interacting with
                   the spatial structure of a landscape for generating
                   spatial patterns and maintaining biodiversity. The
                   relative spatial isolation of a community is
                   traditionally thought to have a large influence on
                   local diversity. However, isolation remains an
                   elusive concept to quantify, particularly in
                   metacommunities with complex spatial structure. We
                   represent the metacommunity as a network of local
                   communities, and use network centrality measures to
                   quantify the isolation of a local community. Using
                   spatially explicit neutral theory, we examine how
                   node position predicts variation in alpha diversity
                   across a metacommunity. We find that diversity
                   increases with node centrality in the network, but
                   only when centrality is measured on a given scale in
                   the network that widens with increasing dispersal
                   rates and narrows with increasing evolutionary rates.
                   More generally, complex biodiversity patterns form
                   only when the underlying geography has structure on
                   this critical scale. This provides a framework for
                   understanding the influence of spatial geographic
                   structure on global biodiversity patterns.

                   Although local and basin-scale differences in
                   riverine fish diversity have been analysed as
                   functions of energy availability and habitat
                   heterogeneity, scale-dependent environmental
                   conditions and river discharge, a model that predicts
                   a comprehensive set of system-wide diversity patterns
                   has been hard to find. Here we show that fish
                   diversity patterns throughout the
                   Mississippi-Missouri River System are well described
                   by a neutral metacommunity model coupled with an
                   appropriate habitat capacity distribution and
                   dispersal kernel. River network structure acts as an
                   effective template for characterizing spatial
                   attributes of fish biodiversity. We show that
                   estimates of average dispersal behaviour and habitat
                   capacities, objectively calculated from average
                   runoff production, yield reliable predictions of
                   large-scale spatial biodiversity patterns in riverine
                   systems. The success of the neutral theory in
                   two-dimensional forest ecosystems and here in
                   dendritic riverine ecosystems suggests the possible
                   application of neutral metacommunity models in a
                   diverse suite of ecosystems. This framework offers
                   direct linkage from large-scale forcing, such as
                   global climate change, to biodiversity patterns.

  abstract =      {A distinctive signature of living systems is
                   Darwinian evolution, that is, a propensity to
                   generate as well as self-select individual diversity.
                   To capture this essential feature of life while
                   describing the dynamics of populations, mathematical
                   models must be rooted in the microscopic, stochastic
                   description of discrete individuals characterized by
                   one or several adaptive traits and interacting with
                   each other. The simplest models assume asexual
                   reproduction and haploid genetics: an offspring
                   usually inherits the trait values of her progenitor,
                   except when a mutation causes the offspring to take a
                   mutation step to new trait values; selection follows
                   from ecological interactions among individuals. Here
                   we present a rigorous construction of the microscopic
                   population process that captures the probabilistic
                   dynamics over continuous time of birth, mutation, and
                   death, as influenced by the trait values of each
                   individual, and interactions between individuals. A
                   by-product of this formal construction is a general
                   algorithm for efficient numerical simulation of the
                   individual-level model. Once the microscopic process
                   is in place, we derive different macroscopic models
                   of adaptive evolution. These models differ in the
                   renormalization they assume, i.e. in the limits
                   taken, in specific orders, on population size,
                   mutation rate, mutation step, while rescaling time
                   accordingly. The macroscopic models also differ in
                   their mathematical nature: deterministic, in the form
                   of ordinary, integro-, or partial differential
                   equations, or probabilistic, like stochastic partial
                   differential equations or superprocesses. These
                   models include extensions of Kimura's equation (and
                   of its approximation for small mutation effects) to
                   frequency- and density-dependent selection. A novel
                   class of macroscopic models obtains when assuming
                   that individual birth and death occur on a short
                   timescale compared with the timescale of typical
                   population growth. On a timescale of very rare
                   mutations, we establish rigorously the models of
                   "trait substitution sequences" and their
                   approximation known as the "canonical equation of
                   adaptive dynamics". We extend these models to account
                   for mutation bias and random drift between multiple
                   evolutionary attractors. The renormalization approach
                   used in this study also opens promising avenues to
                   study and predict patterns of life-history
                   allometries, thereby bridging individual physiology,
                   genetic variation, and ecological interactions in a
                   common evolutionary framework. {\textcopyright} 2006

  abstract =      {The first chapter concerns monotype population
                   models. We first study general birth and death
                   processes and we give non-explosion and extinction
                   criteria, moment computations and a pathwise
                   representation. We then show how different scales may
                   lead to different qualitative approximations, either
                   ODEs or SDEs. The prototypes of these equations are
                   the logistic (deterministic) equation and the
                   logistic Feller diffusion process. The convergence in
                   law of the sequence of processes is proved by
                   tightness-uniqueness argument. In these large
                   population approximations, the competition between
                   individuals leads to nonlinear drift terms. We then
                   focus on models without interaction but including
                   exceptional events due either to demographic
                   stochasticity or to environmental stochasticity. In
                   the first case, an individual may have a large number
                   of offspring and we introduce the class of continuous
                   state branching processes. In the second case,
                   catastrophes may occur and kill a random fraction of
                   the population and the process enjoys a quenched
                   branching property. We emphasize on the study of the
                   Laplace transform, which allows us to classify the
                   long time behavior of these processes. In the second
                   chapter, we model structured populations by
                   measure-valued stochastic differential equations. Our
                   approach is based on the individual dynamics. The
                   individuals are characterized by parameters which
                   have an influence on their survival or reproduction
                   ability. Some of these parameters can be genetic and
                   are inheritable except when mutations occur, but they
                   can also be a space location or a quantity of
                   parasites. The individuals compete for resources or
                   other environmental constraints. We describe the
                   population by a point measure-valued Markov process.
                   We study macroscopic approximations of this process
                   depending on the interplay between different scalings
                   and obtain in the limit either integro-differential
                   equations or reaction-diffusion equations or
                   nonlinear super-processes. In each case, we insist on
                   the specific techniques for the proof of convergence
                   and for the study of the limiting model. The limiting
                   processes offer different models of
                   mutation-selection dynamics. Then, we study two-level
                   models motivated by cell division dynamics, where the
                   cell population is discrete and characterized by a
                   trait, which may be continuous. In 1 particular, we
                   finely study a process for parasite infection and the
                   trait is the parasite load. The latter grows
                   following a Feller diffusion and is randomly shared
                   in the two daughter cells when the cell divides.
                   Finally, we focus on the neutral case when the rate
                   of division of cells is constant but the trait
                   evolves following a general Markov process and may
                   split in a random number of cells. The long time
                   behavior of the structured population is then linked
                   and derived from the behavior a well chosen SDE
                   (monotype population).},

                   modeled for a population with a continuous spatial
                   distribution in an infinite habitat of one or two
                   dimensions. The analysis extends Wright's concept of
                   neighborhood size to spatially autocorrelated
                   sampling variation in the expected phenotype at
                   different locations. Weak stabilizing selection is
                   assumed to operate toward the same optimum phenotype
                   in every locality, and the distribution of dispersal
                   distances from parent to offspring is a (radially)
                   symmetric function. The equilibrium pattern of
                   geographic variation in the expected local phenotype
                   depends on the neighborhood size, the genetic
                   variance within neighborhoods, and the strength of
                   selection, but is nearly independent of the form of
                   the dispersal function. With all else equal,
                   geographic variance is smaller in a two-dimensional
                   habitat than in one dimension, and the covariance
                   between expected local phenotypes decreases more
                   rapidly with the distance separating them in two
                   dimensions than in one. The equilibrium geographic
                   variance is less than the phenotypic variance within
                   localities, unless the neighborhood size is small and
                   selection is extremely weak, especially in two
                   dimensions. Nevertheless, dispersal of geographic
                   variance created by random genetic drift is an
                   important mechanism maintaining genetic variance
                   within local populations. For a Gaussian dispersal
                   function it is shown that, even with a small
                   neighborhood size, a population in a two-dimensional
                   habitat can maintain within neighborhoods most of the
                   genetic variance that would occur in an infinite

                   otherwise arbitrary. The character is determined by
                   purely additive gene action and a stochastically
                   independent environment; its distribution is Gaussian
                   with a constant variance; and it is under Gaussian
                   stabilizing selection with the same parameters in
                   every deme. Linkage disequilibrium is neglected. Most
                   of the results concern the covariances of the local
                   averages. For a finite number of demes, explicit
                   formulas are derived for (i) the asymptotic rate and
                   pattern of convergence to equilibrium, (ii) the
                   variance of a suitably weighted average of the local
                   averages, and (iii) the equilibrium covariances when
                   selection and random drift are much weaker than
                   migration. Essentially complete analyses of
                   equilibrium and convergence are presented for random

  abstract =      {Traditional discussions of speciation are based on
                   geographical patterns of species ranges. In
                   allopatric speciation, long-term geographical
                   isolation generates reproductively isolated and
                   spatially segregated descendant species. In the
                   absence of geographical barriers, diversification is
                   hindered by gene flow. Yet a growing body of
                   phylogenetic and experimental data suggests that
                   closely related species often occur in sympatry or
                   have adjacent ranges in regions over which
                   environmental changes are gradual and do not prevent
                   gene flow. Theory has identified a variety of
                   evolutionary processes that can result in speciation
                   under sympatric conditions, with some recent advances
                   concentrating on the phenomenon of evolutionary
                   branching. Here we establish a link between
                   geographical patterns and ecological processes of
                   speciation by studying evolutionary branching in
                   spatially structured populations. We show that along
                   an environmental gradient, evolutionary branching can
                   occur much more easily than in non-spatial models.
                   This facilitation is most pronounced for gradients of
                   intermediate slope. Moreover, spatial evolutionary
                   branching readily generates patterns of spatial
                   segregation and abutment between the emerging
                   species. Our results highlight the importance of
                   local processes of adaptive divergence for
                   geographical patterns of speciation, and caution
                   against pitfalls of inferring past speciation
                   processes from present biogeographical patterns.},

  abstract =      {We investigate an individual-based model of adaptive
                   radiation based on the biogeographical changes of the
                   Great African Lakes where cichlid fishes radiated. In
                   our model, the landscape consists of a mosaic of
                   three habitat types which may or may not be separated
                   by geographic barriers. We study the effect of the
                   alternation between allopatry and sympatry called
                   landscape dynamics. We show that landscape dynamics
                   can generate a significantly higher diversity than
                   allopatric or sympatric speciation alone.
                   Diversification is mainly due to the joint action of
                   allopatric, ecological divergence, and of disruptive
                   selection increasing assortative mating and allowing
                   for the coexistence in sympatry of species following
                   reinforcement or character displacement. Landscape
                   dynamics possibly increase diversity at each
                   landscape change. The characteristics of the
                   radiation depend on the speed of landscape dynamics
                   and of the number of geographically isolated regions
                   at steady state. Under fast dynamics of a landscape
                   with many fragments, the model predicts a high
                   diversity, possibly subject to the temporary collapse
                   of all species into a hybrid swarm. When fast
                   landscape dynamics induce the recurrent fusion of
                   several sites, diversity is moderate but very stable
                   over time. Under slow landscape dynamics,
                   diversification proceeds similarly, although at a
                   slower pace. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).

                   persistence, niche expansion and local adaptation in
                   spatially heterogeneous environments? In this
                   article, we analyse a demographic and evolutionary
                   model of adaptation to an environment containing two
                   habitats in equal frequencies, and we bridge the gap
                   between different theoretical frameworks.
                   Qualitatively, our model yields four qualitative
                   types of outcomes: (i) global extinction of the
                   population, (ii) adaptation to one habitat only, but
                   also adaptation to both habitats with, (iii)
                   specialized phenotypes or (iv) with generalized
                   phenotypes, and we determine the conditions under
                   which each equilibrium is reached. We derive new
                   analytical approximations for the local densities and
                   the distributions of traits in each habitat under a
                   migration-selection-mutation balance, compute the
                   equilibrium values of the means, variances and
                   asymmetries of the local distributions of phenotypes,
                   and contrast the effects of migration and mutation on
                   the evolutionary outcome. We then check our
                   analytical results by solving our model numerically,
                   and also assess their robustness in the presence of
                   demographic stochasticity. Although increased
                   migration results in a decrease in local adaptation,
                   mutation in our model does not influence the values
                   of the local mean traits. Yet, both migration and
                   mutation can have dramatic effects on population size
                   and even lead to metapopulation extinction when
                   selection is strong. Niche expansion, the ability for
                   the population to adapt to both habitats, can also be
                   prevented by small migration rates and a reduced
                   evolutionary potential characterized by rare mutation
                   events of small effects; however, niche expansion is
                   otherwise the most likely outcome. Although our
                   results are derived under the assumption of clonal
                   reproduction, we finally show and discuss the links
                   between our model and previous quantitative genetics

                   evolutionary processes unfold. To date, several
                   methods have been used to study evolution in spatial
                   systems, including population genetics, quantitative
                   genetics, moment-closure approximations, and
                   individualbased models. Here we extend the study of
                   spatial evolutionary dynamics to eco-evolutionary
                   models based on reaction-diffusion equations and
                   adaptive dynamics. Specifically, we derive
                   expressions for the strength of directional and
                   stabilizing/disruptive selection that apply both in
                   continuous space and to metacommunities with
                   symmetrical dispersal between patches. For
                   directional selection on a quantitative trait, this
                   yields a way to integrate local directional selection
                   across space and determine whether the trait value
                   will increase or decrease. The robustness of this
                   prediction is validated against quantitative
                   genetics. For stabilizing/disruptive selection, we
                   show that spatial heterogeneity always contributes to
                   disruptive selection and hence always promotes
                   evolutionary branching. The expression for
                   directional selection is numerically very efficient
                   and hence lends itself to simulation studies of
                   evolutionary community assembly. We illustrate the
                   application and utility of the expressions for this
                   purpose with two examples of the evolution of
                   resource utilization. Finally, we outline the domain
                   of applicability of reaction-diffusion equations as a
                   modeling framework and discuss their limitations.},

  abstract =      {More than 100 years after Grigg's influential
                   analysis of species' borders, the causes of limits to
                   species' ranges still represent a puzzle that has
                   never been understood with clarity. The topic has
                   become especially important recently as many
                   scientists have become interested in the potential
                   for species' ranges to shift in response to climate
                   change—and yet nearly all of those studies fail to
                   recognise or incorporate evolutionary genetics in a
                   way that relates to theoretical developments. I show
                   that range margins can be understood based on just
                   two measurable parameters: (i) the fitness cost of
                   dispersal—a measure of environmental
                   heterogeneity—and (ii) the strength of genetic
                   drift, which reduces genetic diversity. Together,
                   these two parameters define an ‘expansion
                   threshold': adaptation fails when genetic drift
                   reduces genetic diversity below that required for
                   adaptation to a heterogeneous environment. When the
                   key parameters drop below this expansion threshold
                   locally, a sharp range margin forms. When they drop
                   below this threshold throughout the species' range,
                   adaptation collapses everywhere, resulting in either
                   extinction or formation of a fragmented
                   metapopulation. Because the effects of dispersal
                   differ fundamentally with dimension, the second
                   parameter—the strength of genetic drift—is
                   qualitatively different compared to a linear habitat.
                   In two-dimensional habitats, genetic drift becomes
                   effectively independent of selection. It decreases
                   with ‘neighbourhood size'—the number of
                   individuals accessible by dispersal within one
                   generation. Moreover, in contrast to earlier
                   predictions, which neglected evolution of genetic
                   variance and/or stochasticity in two dimensions,
                   dispersal into small marginal populations aids
                   adaptation. This is because the reduction of both
                   genetic and demographic stochasticity has a stronger
                   effect than the cost of dispersal through increased
                   maladaptation. The expansion threshold thus provides
                   a novel, theoretically justified, and testable
                   prediction for formation of the range margin and
                   collapse of the species' range.},

                   results from the balance between local selection,

                   these different evolutionary forces and demography in
                   a classical two-habitat scenario with asexual
                   reproduction. We develop a new theoretical approach
                   that goes beyond the Adaptive Dynamics framework, and
                   allows us to explore the effect of high mutation
                   rates on the stationary phenotypic distribution. We
                   show that this approach improves the classical
                   Gaussian approximation, and captures accurately the
                   shape of this equilibrium phenotypic distribution in
                   one- and two-population scenarios. We examine the
                   evolutionary equilibrium under general conditions
                   where demography and selection may be nonsymmetric
                   between the two habitats. In particular, we show how
                   migration may increase differentiation in a
                   source–sink scenario. We discuss the implications
                   of these analytic results for the adaptation of

  abstract =      {How the neutral diversity is affected by selection
                   and adaptation is investigated in an eco-evolutionary
                   framework. In our model, we study a finite population
                   in continuous time, where each individual is
                   characterized by a trait under selection and a
                   completely linked neutral marker. Population dynamics
                   are driven by births and deaths, mutations at birth,
                   and competition between individuals. Trait values
                   influence ecological processes (demographic events,
                   competition), and competition generates selection on
                   trait variation, thus closing the eco-evolutionary
                   feedback loop. The demographic effects of the trait
                   are also expected to influence the generation and
                   maintenance of neutral variation. We consider a large
                   population limit with rare mutation, under the
                   assumption that the neutral marker mutates faster
                   than the trait under selection. We prove the
                   convergence of the stochastic individual-based
                   process to a new measure-valued diffusive process
                   with jumps that we call Substitution Fleming-Viot
                   Process (SFVP). When restricted to the trait space
                   this process is the Trait Substitution Sequence first
                   introduced by Metz et al. (1996). During the invasion
                   of a favorable mutation, a genetical bottleneck
                   occurs and the marker associated with this favorable
                   mutant is hitchhiked. By rigorously analysing the
                   hitchhiking effect and how the neutral diversity is
                   restored afterwards, we obtain the condition for a
                   time-scale separation; under this condition, we show
                   that the marker distribution is approximated by a
                   Fleming-Viot distribution between two trait
                   substitutions. We discuss the implications of the
                   SFVP for our understanding of the dynamics of neutral
                   variation under eco-evolutionary feedbacks and
                   illustrate the main phenomena with simulations. Our
                   results highlight the joint importance of mutations,
                   ecological parameters, and trait values in the
                   restoration of neutral diversity after a selective
                   sweep.},

                   This understanding is crucial, not only for improving
                   ecological knowledge, but also for managing properly
                   the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered
                   populations. For nearly 80 years, population
                   geneticists have investigated how physiognomy and
                   other landscape features have influenced genetic
                   variation within and between populations. They have
                   relied on sampling populations that have been
                   identified beforehand because most population
                   genetics methods have required discrete populations.
                   However, a new approach has emerged for analyzing
                   spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete
                   populations be identified in advance. This approach,
                   landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our
                   understanding of how geographical and environmental
                   features structure genetic variation at both the
                   population and individual levels, and has
                   implications for ecology, evolution and conservation
                   biology. It differs from other genetic approaches,
                   such as phylogeography, in that it tends to focus on
                   processes at finer spatial and temporal scales. Here,
                   we discuss, from a population genetic perspective,

                   exchange migrants at a small rate, m. In a stable
                   population structure, the expected genetic variance
                   maintained within islands is identical to that in a
                   panmictic population of the same total size,
                   regardless of the migration rate (m>0). This result
                   contrasts with Wright's classical conclusion, based
                   on inbreeding coefficients, that at least one
                   immigrant per island every other generation (Nm>1/2)
                   is necessary for the genetic variance within local
                   populations to approach that under panmixia. The
                   expected genetic variance maintained among islands is
                   inversely proportional to m and increases with the
                   number of islands, but is independent of N. Local
                   extinction and colonization diminish the genetic
                   variance maintained within islands by reducing the
                   effective size of island populations through the
                   founder effect, although the expected genetic
                   variance within islands is nearly as large as that in
                   a panmictic poulation of the same total effective
                   size. If the founders of new colonies originate from
                   more than one island, rates of local extinction and
                   colonization larger than about twice the migration
                   rate will substantially reduce the genetic variance
                   maintained among islands. Results indicate the
                   importance of mutation and migration in maintaining
                   quantitative genetic variance within small local
                   populations. -Author},

                   genetic differentiation among populations displayed
                   by quantitative traits. Typically, QST is compared to
                   FST measured on putatively neutral loci; if QST =

                   reviews the uses, assumptions and statistics of QST

                   comparisons are statistically challenging. For a
                   single trait, QST must be compared not to the mean

                   sources of biases and sampling error for QST are
                   reviewed, and a new method for comparing QST and FST

                   affected by various deviations from the island model.

                   species which interreact through a specified set of

                   compact, computer-oriented, Monte Carlo simulation

                   modeling the transient behavior of well-mixed

                   topologies, probably due to their different rounding
                   precisions or tie tolerances.},

                   $A+B \to 2B$) defined on networks with heterogeneous
                   topology and no limit on the nodes' occupation

                   on the basic properties of the system's phase diagram

                   topology via multiple-metric analysis on graph
                   ensembles. The paper cautions against studying single
                   metrics or combining disparate graph ensembles from
                   different domains to extract global patterns. This is
                   because there often exists considerable diversity
                   among graphs that share any given topology metric,
                   patterns vary depending on the underlying graph
                   construction model, and many real data sets are not
                   actual statistical ensembles. As real data examples,
                   we present five airline ensembles, comprising
                   temporal snapshots of networks of similar topology.
                   Wikipedia language networks are shown as an example
                   of a nontemporal ensemble. General patterns in metric
                   correlations, as well as exceptions, are discussed by
                   representing the data sets via hierarchically
                   clustered correlation heat maps. Most topology
                   metrics are not independent and their correlation
                   patterns vary across ensembles. In general,
                   density-related metrics and graph distance-based
                   metrics cluster and the two groups are orthogonal to
                   each other. Metrics based on degree-degree
                   correlations have the highest variance across
                   ensembles and cluster the different data sets on par
                   with principal component analysis. Namely, the degree
                   correlation, the s metric, their elasticities, and
                   the rich club moments appear to be most useful in

                   for vertices in networks to be connected to other

                   We consider mixing according to discrete
                   characteristics such as language or race in social
                   networks and scalar characteristics such as age. As a
                   special example of the latter we consider mixing
                   according to vertex degree, i.e., according to the
                   number of connections vertices have to other
                   vertices: do gregarious people tend to associate with
                   other gregarious people? We propose a number of
                   measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the
                   various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of
                   real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing
                   is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We
                   also propose several models of assortatively mixed
                   networks, both analytic ones based on generating
                   function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte
                   Carlo graph generation techniques. We use these
                   models to probe the properties of networks as their
                   level of assortativity is varied. In the particular
                   case of mixing by degree, we find strong variation
                   with assortativity in the connectivity of the network
                   and in the resilience of the network to the removal

                   detail. Here, classical two-patch models are extended

                   for conserving endangered species in fragmented
                   landscapes. However, determining which habitats
                   should be set aside to promote connectivity has been
                   difficult because existing models cannot incorporate
                   effects of multiple pathways linking populations.
                   Here, we test an ecological connectivity model that
                   overcomes this obstacle by borrowing from electrical
                   circuit theory. The model vastly improves gene flow
                   predictions because it simultaneously integrates all
                   possible pathways connecting populations. When
                   applied to data from threatened mammal and tree
                   species, the model consistently outperformed
                   conventional gene flow models, revealing that

                   across scales is a central goal of ecology. Both
                   environmental gradients and spatial landscape
                   structure have been found to be important factors
                   influencing species distributions and community
                   composition, and partly reflect the balance of
                   underlying deterministic and stochastic community
                   processes. In some systems, environmental gradients
                   and spatial connectivity are intertwined in that
                   steep environmental gradients serve as boundaries on
                   species movements and impose environment-derived
                   complex spatial structure to metacommunities.
                   Mountainous landscapes are prime examples of this,
                   and recent theory has linked principles of
                   geomorphology, environmental gradients, and spatial
                   structure to make predictions for resulting community
                   patterns. In this context, we examine variation in
                   taxonomic and phylogenetic ant diversity patterns
                   along a geographic transect spanning > 5000 m in
                   elevational range in the Hengduan mountains of
                   southern China. We found that environmental gradients
                   dominate variation in both alpha and beta diversity
                   in this landscape, with alpha diversity strongly
                   declining with elevation and beta diversity driven by
                   elevational differences. However, within an
                   elevational band spatial connectivity predicts beta
                   diversity better than geographic distance. Our
                   findings deviate from theoretical predictions in
                   several ways, notably alpha diversity is
                   monotonically declining and within-band beta
                   diversity is invariant with increasing elevation. The
                   discrepancies between theory and observation may be
                   explained by differences in the Hengduan landscape
                   from idealized fluvial landscapes, such as a lack of
                   a mid-elevation peak in connectivity, as well as
                   evolutionary limits on the source pool of species
                   available to populate metacommunities at different
                   elevations. The latter is supported by variation in
                   phylogenetic community structure with elevation. Our
                   results demonstrate the power of conceptual,
                   statistical, and theoretical frameworks that
                   integrate the roles of environment and spatial
                   structure in metacommunities, but that additional
                   work is needed to bridge the gap between abstract

                   difficulty of compiling high-resolution databases at
                   continental scales. We used a database of the
                   geographic ranges of 2,869 species of birds breeding
                   in South America (nearly a third of the world's
                   living avian species) to explore the influence of
                   climate, quadrat area, ecosystem diversity, and
                   topography on species richness gradients at 10
                   spatial scales (quadrat area, ≈12,300 to
                   ≈1,225,000 km2). Topography, precipitation,
                   topography x latitude, ecosystem diversity, and cloud
                   cover emerged as the most important predictors of
                   regional variability of species richness in
                   regression models incorporating 16 independent
                   variables, although ranking of variables depended on
                   spatial scale. Direct measures of ambient energy such
                   as mean and maximum temperature were of ancillary
                   importance. Species richness values for 1° × 1°
                   latitude-longitude quadrats in the Andes (peaking at
                   845 species) were ≈30-250{\%} greater than those
                   recorded at equivalent latitudes in the central
                   Amazon basin. These findings reflect the
                   extraordinary abundance of species associated with
                   humid montane regions at equatorial latitudes and the
                   importance of orography in avian speciation. In a

                   that terrestrial species richness from the equator to
                   the poles is ultimately governed by a synergism

                   crucial primary production and ecosystem structure.
                   To date, our quantitative understanding of diversity
                   gradients of megadiverse clades such as plants has
                   been hampered by the paucity of distribution data.
                   Here, we investigate the global-scale
                   species-richness pattern of vascular plants and
                   examine its environmental and potential historical
                   determinants. Across 1,032 geographic regions
                   worldwide, potential evapotranspiration, the number
                   of wet days per year, and measurements of
                   topographical and habitat heterogeneity emerge as
                   core predictors of species richness. After accounting
                   for environmental effects, the residual differences
                   across the major floristic kingdoms are minor, with
                   the exception of the uniquely diverse Cape Region,
                   highlighting the important role of historical
                   contingencies. Notably, the South African Cape region
                   contains more than twice as many species as expected
                   by the global environmental model, confirming its
                   uniquely evolved flora. A combined multipredictor
                   model explains ≈70{\%} of the global variation in
                   species richness and fully accounts for the enigmatic
                   latitudinal gradient in species richness. The models
                   illustrate the geographic interplay of different
                   environmental predictors of species richness. Our
                   findings highlight that different hypotheses about
                   the causes of diversity gradients are not mutually
                   exclusive, but likely act synergistically with
                   water-energy dynamics playing a dominant role. The
                   presented geostatistical approach is likely to prove
                   instrumental for identifying richness patterns of the
                   many other taxa without single-species distribution
                   data that still escape our understanding.

  abstract =      {A major goal of ecology is to determine the causes of
                   the latitudinal gradient in global distribution of
                   species richness. Current evidence points to either
                   energy availability or habitat heterogeneity as the
                   most likely environmental drivers in terrestrial
                   systems, but their relative importance is
                   controversial in the absence of analyses of global
                   (rather than continental or regional) extent. Here we
                   use data on the global distribution of extant
                   continental and continental island bird species to
                   test the explanatory power of energy availability and
                   habitat heterogeneity while simultaneously addressing
                   issues of spatial resolution, spatial
                   autocorrelation, geometric constraints upon species'
                   range dynamics, and the impact of human populations
                   and historical glacial ice-cover. At the finest
                   resolution (1°), topographical variability and
                   temperature are identified as the most important
                   global predictors of avian species richness in
                   multi-predictor models. Topographical variability is
                   most important in single-predictor models, followed
                   by productive energy. Adjusting for null expectations
                   based on geometric constraints on species richness
                   improves overall model fit but has negligible impact
                   on tests of environmental predictors. Conclusions
                   concerning the relative importance of environmental
                   predictors of species richness cannot be extrapolated
                   from one biogeographic realm to others or the globe.

                   patterns of species diversity from the relatively
                   local scale of communities to the broad
                   biogeographical scale of continents. However, the
                   effects of heterogeneity on species diversity have
                   not been studied as widely at intermediate scales
                   although differences among landscapes in local
                   climate and habitat should maintain beta-diversity.
                   Location Bailey ecoregions in the USA. Methods: Using
                   a geographically extensive dataset on bird
                   distribution and abundance in 35 ecoregions, we
                   tested for the effects of habitat and climate
                   heterogeneity on beta-diversity at two discrete
                   spatial scales: among sample points within
                   landscapes, and among landscapes within ecoregions.
                   Results: Landscape-level beta-diversity typically
                   accounted for 50%; or more of gamma-diversity and was
                   significantly and positively related to habitat
                   heterogeneity (elevational range within an ecoregion)
                   and climate heterogeneity (variation in potential
                   evapotranspiration). Contrary to predictions,
                   point-level beta-diversity was negatively related to
                   habitat and climate heterogeneity, perhaps because
                   heterogeneity constrains alpha-diversity at the
                   landscape level. The geographical spatial separation
                   of landscapes within an ecoregion did not
                   significantly affect beta-diversity at either scale.
                   Main conclusions: Our results suggest that habitat
                   selection and adaptation to local climate may be the
                   primary processes structuring bird diversity among
                   landscapes within ecoregions, and that dispersal
                   limitation has a lesser role in influencing
                   beta-diversity among landscapes. {\textcopyright}

                   and divergent adaptation are thought to enhance
                   species coexistence, persistence and diversification.
                   However, the extent and generality of positive
                   heterogeneity-richness relationships are still
                   debated. Apart from widespread evidence supporting
                   positive relationships, negative and hump-shaped
                   relationships have also been reported. In a
                   meta-analysis of 1148 data points from 192 studies

                   grain and spatial extent emerge as key factors
                   influencing the strength of heterogeneity-richness
                   relationships, highlighting the pervasive influence
                   of spatial scale in heterogeneity-richness studies.
                   We provide the first quantitative support for the
                   generality of positive heterogeneity-richness

                   Inferential methods are commonly based on models
                   making various strong assumptions: demography and
                   population structures are supposed a priori known,
                   the evolution of the genetic composition of a

                   between and within genetic strains. In this paper, we
                   present a stochastic birth-death model with
                   competitive interactions and asexual reproduction. We
                   develop an inferential procedure for ecological,

                   how genetic diversity and genealogies are related to
                   birth and death rates, and to how individuals compete
                   within and between strains. This leads us to propose
                   an original model of phylogenies, with trait

                   may occur more quickly in some regions than in

  abstract =      {Despite growing interest in the effects of landscape
                   heterogeneity on genetic structuring, few tools are
                   available to incorporate data on landscape
                   composition into population genetic studies. Analyses
                   of isolation by distance have typically either
                   assumed spatial homogeneity for convenience or
                   applied theoretically unjustified distance metrics to
                   compensate for heterogeneity. Here I propose the
                   isolation-by-resistance (IBR) model as an alternative
                   for predicting equilibrium genetic structuring in
                   complex landscapes. The model predicts a positive
                   relationship between genetic differentiation and the
                   resistance distance, a distance metric that exploits
                   precise relationships between random walk times and
                   effective resistances in electronic networks. As a
                   predictor of genetic differentiation, the resistance
                   distance is both more theoretically justified and
                   more robust to spatial heterogeneity than Euclidean
                   or least cost path-based distance measures. Moreover,
                   the metric can be applied with a wide range of data
                   inputs, including coarse-scale range maps, simple
                   maps of habitat and nonhabitat within a species'
                   range, or complex spatial datasets with habitats and
                   barriers of differing qualities. The IBR model thus
                   provides a flexible and efficient tool to account for

                   on ecological dynamics is a central theme in ecology.
                   Recently, research has recognised the relevance of
                   river and river-analogue network structures, because
                   these systems are not only highly diverse but also
                   rapidly changing due to habitat modifications or
                   species invasions. Much of the previous work on
                   ecological and evolutionary dynamics in
                   metapopulations and metacommunities in dendritic
                   river networks has been either using comparative
                   approaches or was purely theoretical. However, the
                   use of microcosm experiments provides the unique
                   opportunity to study large-scale questions in a
                   causal and experimental framework. We conducted
                   replicated microcosm experiments, in which we
                   manipulated the spatially explicit network
                   configuration of a landscape and addressed how linear
                   versus dendritic connectivity affects population
                   dynamics, specifically the spatial distribution of
                   population densities, and movement behaviour of the
                   protist model organism Tetrahymena pyriformis. We
                   tracked population densities and individual-level
                   movement behaviour of thousands of individuals over
                   time. At the end of the experiment, we found more
                   variable population densities between patches in
                   dendritic networks compared to linear networks, as
                   predicted by theory. Specifically, in dendritic
                   networks, population densities were higher at nodes
                   that connected to headwaters compared to the
                   headwaters themselves and to more central nodes in
                   the network. These differences follow theoretical
                   predictions and emerged from the different network
                   topologies per se. These differences in population
                   densities emerged despite weakly density-dependent
                   movement. We show that differences in network
                   structure alone can cause characteristic spatial
                   variation in population densities. While such
                   differences have been postulated by theoretical work
                   and are the underlying precondition for differential
                   dispersal evolution in heterogeneous networks, our
                   results may be the first experimental demonstration
                   thereof. Furthermore, these population-level dynamics
                   may affect extinction risks and can upscale to
                   previously shown metacommunity level diversity
                   dynamics. Given that many species in natural river
                   systems exhibit strong spatiotemporal patterns in
                   population densities, our work suggests that
                   abundance patterns should not only be addressed from
                   a local environmental perspective, but may be the
                   outcome of processes that are inherently driven by
                   the respective habitat network structure.},

                   evolutionary ecologists working across diverse
                   systems for decades. However, little of this research
                   has explored variation at microgeographic scales
                   because it has often been assumed that high rates of
                   gene flow will prevent adaptive divergence at fine
                   spatial scales. Here, we establish a quantitative
                   definition of microgeographic adaptation based on
                   Wright's dispersal neighborhood that standardizes
                   dispersal abilities, enabling this measure to be
                   compared across species. We use this definition to
                   evaluate growing evidence of evolutionary divergence
                   at fine spatial scales. We identify the main
                   mechanisms known to facilitate this adaptation and
                   highlight illustrative examples of microgeographic
                   evolution in nature. Collectively, this evidence
                   requires that we revisit our understanding of the
                   spatial scale of adaptation and consider how
                   microgeographic adaptation and its driving mechanisms
                   can fundamentally alter ecological and evolutionary

                   selection in a continuously distributed, infinite

                   spatial variation in selective pressures are
                   considered, including a step change in the
                   environment, a "pocket" in the environment and a
                   periodically varying environment. Also, the problem
                   of the effect of a geographic barrier to dispersal is
                   analyzed. The results are: (1) there is a
                   characteristic length scale of variation of gene
                   frequencies, (see PDF). The population cannot respond
                   to changes in environmental conditions which occur
                   over a distance less than the characteristic length.
                   The result does not depend either on the pattern of
                   variation in selective pressures or on the exact
                   shape of the dispersal function. (2) The reduction in
                   the fitness of the heterozygote causes a cline in
                   gene frequencies to become steeper. (3) A geographic
                   barrier to dispersal causes a drastic change in the
                   gene frequencies at the barrier only when almost all
                   of the individuals trying to cross the barrier are

                   conditions, gradually expanding their ecological
                   niche and geographic range? Gene flow across
                   environments has two conflicting effects: although it
                   increases genetic variation, which is a prerequisite
                   for adaptation, gene flow may swamp adaptation to
                   local conditions. In 1956, Haldane proposed that,
                   when the environment varies across space, "swamping"
                   by gene flow creates a positive feedback between low
                   population size and maladaptation, leading to a sharp
                   range margin. However, current deterministic theory
                   shows that, when variance can evolve, there is no
                   such limit. Using simple analytical tools and
                   simulations, we show that genetic drift can generate
                   a sharp margin to a species' range, by reducing
                   genetic variance below the level needed for
                   adaptation to spatially variable conditions. Aided by
                   separation of ecological and evolutionary timescales,
                   the identified effective dimensionless parameters
                   reveal a simple threshold that predicts when
                   adaptation at the range margin fails. Two observable
                   parameters determine the threshold: (i) the effective
                   environmental gradient, which can be measured by the
                   loss of fitness due to dispersal to a different
                   environment; and (ii) the efficacy of selection
                   relative to genetic drift. The theory predicts sharp
                   range margins even in the absence of abrupt changes
                   in the environment. Furthermore, it implies that
                   gradual worsening of conditions across a species'
                   habitat may lead to a sudden range fragmentation,
                   when adaptation to a wide span of conditions within a
                   single species becomes impossible.},

                   of populations colonizing new environments. Yet their
                   interaction is largely unresolved. Using a
                   single-species population model along a
                   one-dimensional environmental gradient, we show how
                   local competition and dispersal jointly shape the

                   a focal introduction site, the generic pattern
                   predicted by our model features a temporal transition
                   from wave-like to pulsed invasion. Each regime is
                   driven primarily by local adaptation, while the
                   transition is caused by eco-evolutionary feedbacks
                   mediated by dispersal. The interaction range and cost
