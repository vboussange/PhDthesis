Abstract = {In recent years, tremendous progress has been made on numerical
   algorithms for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in a very
   high dimension, using ideas from either nonlinear (multilevel) Monte
   Carlo or deep learning. They are potentially free of the curse of
   dimensionality for many different applications and have been proven to
   be so in the case of some nonlinear Monte Carlo methods for nonlinear
   parabolic PDEs. In this paper, we review these numerical and theoretical
   advances. In addition to algorithms based on stochastic reformulations
   of the original problem, such as the multilevel Picard iteration and the
   deep backward stochastic differential equations method, we also discuss
   algorithms based on the more traditional Ritz, Galerkin, and least
   square formulations. We hope to demonstrate to the reader that studying
   PDEs as well as control and variational problems in very high dimensions
   might very well be among the most promising new directions in
   mathematics and scientific computing in the near future.},

Abstract = {Standard approaches to the theory of financial markets are based on
   equilibrium and efficiency. Here we develop an alternative based on
   concepts and methods developed by biologists, in which the wealth
   invested in a financial strategy is like the abundance of a species. We
   study a toy model of a market consisting of value investors, trend
   followers, and noise traders. We show that the average returns of
   strategies are strongly density dependent; that is, they depend on the
   wealth invested in each strategy at any given time. In the absence of
   noise, the market would slowly evolve toward an efficient equilibrium,
   but the statistical uncertainty in profitability (which is calibrated to
   match real markets) makes this noisy and uncertain. Even in the long
   term, the market spends extended periods of time away from perfect
   efficiency. We show how core concepts from ecology, such as the
   community matrix and food webs, give insight into market behavior. For
   example, at the efficient equilibrium, all three strategies have a
   mutualistic relationship, meaning that an increase in the wealth of one
   increases the returns of the others. The wealth dynamics of the market
   ecosystem explain how market inefficiencies spontaneously occur and
   gives insight into the origins of excess price volatility and deviations
   of prices from fundamental values.},

Abstract = {Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in diverse applications;
   however, its use in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has
   emerged only recently. Here, we present an overview of physics-informed
   neural networks (PINNs), which embed a PDE into the loss of the neural
   network using automatic differentiation. The PINN algorithm is simple,
   and it can be applied to different types of PDEs, including
   integro-differential equations, fractional PDEs, and stochastic PDEs.
   Moreover, from an implementation point of view, PINNs solve inverse
   problems as easily as forward problems. We propose a new residual-based
   adaptive refinement (RAR) method to improve the training efficiency of
   PINNs. For pedagogical reasons, we compare the PINN algorithm to a
   standard finite element method. We also present a Python library for
   PINNs, DeepXDE, which is designed to serve both as an educational tool
   to be used in the classroom as well as a research tool for solving
   problems in computational science and engineering. Specifically, DeepXDE
   can solve forward problems given initial and boundary conditions, as
   well as inverse problems given some extra measurements. DeepXDE supports
   complex-geometry domains based on the technique of constructive solid
   geometry and enables the user code to be compact, resembling closely the
   mathematical formulation. We introduce the usage of DeepXDE and its
   customizability, and we also demonstrate the capability of PINNs and the
   user-friendliness of DeepXDE for five different examples. More broadly,
   DeepXDE contributes to the more rapid development of the emerging
   scientific machine learning field.},

   boundary condition, the dynamics of solutions is driven/controlled by
   the boundary data in the large-time limit. As an application, similar

Abstract = {Dynamics of human populations can be affected by various socio-economic
   factors through their influence on the natality and mortality rates, and
   on the migration intensity and directions. In this work we study an
   economic-demographic model which takes into account the dependence of
   the wealth production rate on the available resources. In the case of
   nonlocal consumption of resources, the homogeneous-in-space
   wealth-population distribution is replaced by a periodic-in-space
   distribution for which the total wealth increases. For the global
   consumption of resources, if the wealth redistribution is small enough,
   then the homogeneous distribution is replaced by a heterogeneous one
   with a single wealth accumulation center. Thus, economic and demographic
   characteristics of nonlocal and global economies can be quite different
   in comparison with the local economy.},

Title = {From species sorting to mass effects: spatial network structure mediates
   the shift between metacommunity archetypes},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {44},
Number = {5},
Pages = {715-726},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Local assemblages are embedded in networks of communities connected by
   dispersal, and understanding the processes that mediate this
   local-regional interaction is central to understanding biodiversity
   patterns. In this network (i.e. metacommunity), the strength of
   dispersal relative to the intensity of environmental selection typically
   determines whether local communities are comprised of species
   well-adapted to the local environment (i.e. species sorting) or are
   dominated by regionally successful species that may not be locally
   adapted (i.e. mass effects), which by extension determines the capacity
   of the landscape to sustain diversity. Despite the fundamentally spatial
   nature of these dispersal-mediated processes, much of our theoretical
   understanding comes from spatially implicit systems, a special case of
   spatial structure in which patches are all connected to each other
   equally. In many real systems, both the connections among patches (i.e.
   network topology) and the distributions of environments across patches
   (i.e. spatial autocorrelation) are not arranged uniformly. Here, we use
   a metacommunity model to investigate how spatial heterogeneities may
   change the balance between species sorting versus mass effects and
   diversity outcomes. Our simulations show that, in general, the spatially
   implicit model generates an outlier in biodiversity patterns compared to
   other networks, and most likely amplifies mass effects relative to
   species sorting. Network topology has a strong effect on metacommunity
   outcome, with topologies of sparse connections and few loops promoting
   sorting of species into suitable patches. Spatial autocorrelation is
   another key factor; by interacting with spatial topology,
   intermediate-scale clusters of similar patches can emerge, leading to a
   reduction of regional competition, and hence maintenance of gamma
   diversity. These results provide a better understanding of the role that
   complex spatial landscape structure plays in metacommunity processes, a
   necessary step to understanding how metacommunity processes relate to
   biodiversity conservation.},

Abstract = {Keywords
   Economic complexity involves the use of machine learning and network
   techniques to predict and explain the economic trajectories of
   countries, cities and regions. Measures of relatedness - which estimate
   the affinity between economies and activities - anticipate changes in
   specialization patterns and explain labour market outcomes, such as
   income loss and unemployment. Economic complexity measures are
   reduced-dimensionality representations of specialization matrices that
   explain the geography of hundreds of economic activities. Measures of
   economic complexity explain and predict international and regional
   variations in income, economic growth, income inequality, gender
   inequality and greenhouse emissions. Economic complexity methods have
   been validated by studies at multiple geographic scales (from countries
   to cities) and a variety of economic activities (products, industries,
   occupations, patents, research papers). Relatedness metrics can be
   unpacked into multiple channels (such as industry, occupation and
   location-specific knowledge) to understand the drivers of regional
   diversification.
   Economic complexity methods predict changes in the geography of economic
   activities and explain differences in economic growth, inequality,
   greenhouse emissions and labour market outcomes. This Review summarizes
   a decade of research on economic complexity and its applications.
   Economic complexity methods have become popular tools in economic
   geography, international development and innovation studies. Here, I
   review economic complexity theory and applications, with a particular
   focus on two streams of literature: the literature on relatedness, which
   focuses on the evolution of specialization patterns, and the literature
   on metrics of economic complexity, which uses dimensionality reduction
   techniques to create metrics of economic sophistication that are
   predictive of variations in income, economic growth, emissions and
   income inequality.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a numerical method for nonlinear parabolic
   partial differential equations (PDEs) that combines operator splitting
   with deep learning. It divides the PDE approximation problem into a
   sequence of separate learning problems. Since the computational graph
   for each of the subproblems is comparatively small, the approach can
   handle extremely high dimensional PDEs. We test the method on different
   examples from physics, stochastic control, and mathematical finance. In
   all cases, it yields very good results in up to 10,000 dimensions with
   short run times.},

Abstract = {For a long time it has been well-known that high-dimensional linear
   parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) can be approximated by
   Monte Carlo methods with a computational effort which grows polynomially
   both in the dimension and in the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy.
   In other words, linear PDEs do not suffer from the curse of
   dimensionality. For general semilinear PDEs with Lipschitz coefficients,
   however, it remained an open question whether these suffer from the
   curse of dimensionality. In this paper we partially solve this open
   problem. More precisely, we prove in the case of semilinear heat
   equations with gradient-independent and globally Lipschitz continuous
   nonlinearities that the computational effort of a variant of the
   recently introduced multilevel Picard approximations grows at most
   polynomially both in the dimension and in the reciprocal of the required
   accuracy.},

Abstract = {Genetic data are often used to infer demographic history and changes or
   detect genes under selection. Inferential methods are commonly based on
   models making various strong assumptions: demography and population
   structures are supposed a priori known, the evolution of the genetic
   composition of a population does not affect demography nor population
   structure, and there is no selection nor interaction between and within
   genetic strains. In this paper, we present a stochastic birth-death
   model with competitive interactions and asexual reproduction. We develop
   an inferential procedure for ecological, demographic, and genetic
   parameters. We first show how genetic diversity and genealogies are
   related to birth and death rates, and to how individuals compete within
   and between strains. This leads us to propose an original model of
   phylogenies, with trait structure and interactions, that allows multiple
   merging. Second, we develop an Approximate Bayesian Computation
   framework to use our model for analyzing genetic data. We apply our
   procedure to simulated data from a toy model, and to real data by
   analyzing the genetic diversity of microsatellites on Y-chromosomes
   sampled from Central Asia human populations in order to test whether
   different social organizations show significantly different fertilities.},

Abstract = {The Firm Ecosystem Model is a dynamical model based on the empirical
   finding that firm characteristics, such as the tendency to innovate and
   competitive advantages, vary according to firm size. Firm dynamics
   leading to various population distributions are considered as a
   competition-colonization scenario in a spatially defined market, where
   firms of differing sizes are treated as separate species with different
   competition and colonization characteristics. Smaller firms, given
   adequate investment funds to innovate, are able to colonize available
   space more quickly than larger firms, and larger firms are assumed to
   have stronger competition characteristics and are able to outcompete
   smaller firms for occupied space. With startup and mortality parameters
   determined empirically, firm populations reach equilibria dependent on
   the values of the capital investment parameters. The model predictions
   provide a good qualitative fit to empirical data from the Business
   Dynamics Statistics database. Finally, we explore how alternative
   mortality or investment conditions affect the firm size distributions.},

Abstract = {We consider a mathematical model for the evolutionary dynamics of tumour
   cells in vascularised tumours under chemotherapy. The model comprises a
   system of coupled partial integro-differential equations for the
   phenotypic distribution of tumour cells, the concentration of oxygen and
   the concentration of a chemotherapeutic agent. In order to disentangle
   the impact of different evolutionary parameters on the emergence of
   intra-tumour phenotypic heterogeneity and the development of resistance
   to chemotherapy, we construct explicit solutions to the equation for the
   phenotypic distribution of tumour cells and provide a detailed
   quantitative characterisation of the long-time asymptotic behaviour of
   such solutions. Analytical results are integrated with numerical
   simulations of a calibrated version of the model based on biologically
   consistent parameter values. The results obtained provide a theoretical
   explanation for the observation that the phenotypic properties of tumour
   cells in vascularised tumours vary with the distance from the blood
   vessels. Moreover, we demonstrate that lower oxygen levels may correlate
   with higher levels of phenotypic variability, which suggests that the
   presence of hypoxic regions supports intra-tumour phenotypic
   heterogeneity. Finally, the results of our analysis put on a rigorous
   mathematical basis the idea, previously suggested by formal asymptotic
   results and numerical simulations, that hypoxia favours the selection
   for chemoresistant phenotypic variants prior to treatment. Consequently,
   this facilitates the development of resistance following chemotherapy.},

Abstract = {We provide a review of recent advancements in non-local continuous
   models for migration, mainly from the perspective of its involvement in
   embryonal development and cancer invasion. Particular emphasis is placed
   on spatial non-locality occurring in advection terms, used to
   characterize a cell's motility bias according to its interactions with
   other cellular and acellular components in its vicinity (e.g. cell-cell
   and cell-tissue adhesions, non-local chemotaxis), but we also briefly
   address spatially non-local source terms. Following a short introduction
   and description of applications, we give a systematic classification of
   available PDE models with respect to the type of featured non-localities
   and review some of the mathematical challenges arising from such models,
   with a focus on analytical aspects. This article is part of the theme

Title = {The dynamics of trait variance in multi-species communities},
Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {In this paper, we establish the explicit connection between
   deterministic trait-based population-level models (in the form of
   partial differential equations) and species-level models (in the form of
   ordinary differential equations), in the context of eco-evolutionary
   systems. In particular, by starting from a population-level model of
   density distributions in trait space, we derive what amounts to an
   extension of the typical models at the species level known from adaptive
   dynamics literature, to account not only for abundance and mean trait
   values, but also explicitly for trait variances. Thus, we arrive at an
   explicitly polymorphic model at the species level. The derivations make
   precise the relationship between the parameters in the two classes of
   models and allow us to distinguish between notions of fitness on the
   population and species levels. Through a formal stability analysis, we
   see that exponential growth of an eigenvalue in the trait covariance
   matrix corresponds to a breakdown of the underlying assumptions of the
   species-level model. In biological terms, this may be interpreted as a
   speciation event: that is, we obtain an explicit notion of the blow-up
   of the variance of (possibly a linear combination of) traits as a
   precursor to speciation. Moreover, since evolutionary volatility of the
   mean trait value is proportional to trait variance, this provides a
   notion that species at the cusp of speciation are also the most
   adaptive. We illustrate these concepts and considerations using a
   numerical simulation.},

Title = {Dynamics of adaptation in an anisotropic phenotype-fitness landscape},
Journal = {NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {54},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We study the dynamics of adaptation of a large asexual population in a
   n-dimensional phenotypic space, under anisotropic mutation and selection
   effects. When n = 1 or under isotropy assumptions, the
   `replicator-mutator' equation is a standard model to describe these
   dynamics. However, the n-dimensional anisotropic case remained largely
   unexplored.
   We prove here that the equation admits a unique solution, which is
   interpreted as the phenotype distribution, and we propose a new and
   general framework to the study of the quantitative behaviour of this
   solution. Our method builds upon a degenerate nonlocal parabolic
   equation satisfied by the distribution of the `fitness components', and
   a nonlocal transport equation satisfied by the cumulant generating
   function of the joint distribution of these components. This last
   equation can be solved analytically and we then get a general formula
   for the trajectory of the mean fitness and all higher cumulants of the
   fitness distribution, over time. Such mean fitness trajectory is the
   typical outcome of empirical studies of adaptation by experimental
   evolution, and can thus be compared to empirical data.
   In sharp contrast with the known results based on isotropic models, our
   results show that the trajectory of mean fitness may exhibit (n - 1)
   plateaus before it converges. It may thus appear `non-saturating' for a
   transient but possibly long time, even though a phenotypic optimum
   exists. To illustrate the empirical relevance of these results, we show
   that the anisotropic model leads to a very good fit of Escherichia coli
   long-term evolution experiment, one of the most famous experimental
   dataset in experimental evolution. The two `evolutionary epochs' that
   have been observed in this experiment have long puzzled the community:
   we propose that the pattern may simply stem from a climbing hill
   process, but in an anisotropic fitness landscape. (C) 2020 Published by

Abstract = {Understanding how alpine biotas formed in response to historical
   environmental change may improve our ability to predict and mitigate the
   threats to alpine species posed by global warming. In the world's
   richest temperate alpine flora, that of the Tibet-Himalaya-Hengduan
   region, phylogenetic reconstructions of biome and geographic range
   evolution show that extant lineages emerged by the early Oligocene and
   diversified first in the Hengduan Mountains. By the early to middle
   Miocene, accelerated diversification and colonization of adjacent
   regions were likely driven jointly by mountain building and
   intensification of the Asian monsoon. The alpine flora of the Hengduan
   Mountains has continuously existed far longer than any other alpine
   flora on Earth and illustrates how modern biotas have been shaped by
   past geological and climatic events.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) are used with huge success to
   model phenomena across all scientific and engineering disciplines.
   However, across an equally wide swath, there exist situations in which
   PDEs fail to adequately model observed phenomena, or are not the best
   available model for that purpose. On the other hand, in many situations,
   nonlocal models that account for interaction occurring at a distance
   have been shown to more faithfully and effectively model observed
   phenomena that involve possible singularities and other anomalies. In
   this article we consider a generic nonlocal model, beginning with a
   short review of its definition, the properties of its solution, its
   mathematical analysis and of specific concrete examples. We then provide
   extensive discussions about numerical methods, including finite element,
   finite difference and spectral methods, for determining approximate
   solutions of the nonlocal models considered. In that discussion, we pay
   particular attention to a special class of nonlocal models that are the
   most widely studied in the literature, namely those involving fractional
   derivatives. The article ends with brief considerations of several
   modelling and algorithmic extensions, which serve to show the wide
   applicability of nonlocal modelling.},

Abstract = {In this paper we focus on qualitative properties of solutions to a
   nonlocal nonlinear partial integro-differential equation (PIDE). Using
   the theory of abstract semilinear parabolic equations we prove existence
   and uniqueness of a solution in the scale of Bessel potential spaces.
   Our aim is to generalize known existence results for a wide class of
   Levy measures including with a strong singular kernel. As an application
   we consider a class of PIDEs arising in the financial mathematics. The
   classical linear Black-Scholes model relies on several restrictive
   assumptions such as liquidity and completeness of the market. Relaxing
   the complete market hypothesis and assuming a Levy stochastic process
   dynamics for the underlying stock price process we obtain a model for
   pricing options by means of a PIDE. We investigate a model for pricing
   call and put options on underlying assets following a Levy stochastic
   process with jumps. We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to
   the penalized PIDE representing approximation of the linear
   complementarity problem arising in pricing American style of options
   under Levy stochastic processes. We also present numerical results and
   comparison of option prices for various Levy stochastic processes
   modelling underlying asset dynamics.},

Abstract = {We develop a novel numerical method for pricing American options under

   integro-differential complementarity problem (PIDCP). By using a penalty
   approach, the PIDCP results in a nonlinear partial integro-differential
   equation (PIDE). To numerically solve this nonlinear penalized PIDE, a
   fitted finite volume method is introduced for the spatial discretization
   and the Backward Euler and Crank-Nicolson schemes for the time
   discretization. We show that these schemes are consistent, stable and
   monotone, hence convergence to the solution of continuous problem.
   Numerical experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of this

Abstract = {Adaptation in spatially heterogeneous environments results from the
   balance between local selection, mutation, and migration. We study the
   interplay among these different evolutionary forces and demography in a
   classical two-habitat scenario with asexual reproduction. We develop a
   new theoretical approach that goes beyond the Adaptive Dynamics
   framework, and allows us to explore the effect of high mutation rates on
   the stationary phenotypic distribution. We show that this approach
   improves the classical Gaussian approximation, and captures accurately
   the shape of this equilibrium phenotypic distribution in one- and
   two-population scenarios. We examine the evolutionary equilibrium under
   general conditions where demography and selection may be nonsymmetric
   between the two habitats. In particular, we show how migration may
   increase differentiation in a source-sink scenario. We discuss the
   implications of these analytic results for the adaptation of organisms
   with large mutation rates, such as RNA viruses.},

Title = {Neutral and niche forces as drivers of species selection},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {483},
Month = {DEC 21},
Abstract = {The evolutionary and ecological processes behind the origin of species
   are among the most fundamental problems in biology. In fact, many
   theoretical hypothesis on different type of speciation have been
   proposed. In particular, models of sympatric speciation leading to the
   formation of new species without geographical isolation, are based on
   the niche hypothesis: the diversification of the population is induced
   by the competition for a limited set of available resources.
   Interestingly, neutral models of evolution have shown that stochastic
   forces are sufficient to generate coexistence of different species. In
   this work, we put forward this dichotomy within the context of species
   formation, studying how neutral and niche forces contribute to sympatric
   speciation in a model ecosystem. In particular, we study the evolution
   of a population of individuals with asexual reproduction whose inherited
   characters or phenotypes are specified by both niche-based and neutral
   traits. We analyze the stationary state of the dynamics, and study the
   distribution of individuals in the whole phenotypic space. We show, both
   numerically and analytically, that there is a non-trivial coupling
   between neutral and niche forces induced by stochastic effects in the
   evolution of the population allowing the formation of clusters, that is,
   species in the phenotypic space. Remarkably, our framework can be
   generalized also to sexual reproduction or other type of population
   dynamics. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {We consider a class of non-local reaction-diffusion problems, referred
   to as replicator-mutator equations in evolutionary genetics. For a
   confining fitness function, we prove well-posedness and write the
   solution explicitly, via some underlying Schrodinger spectral elements
   (for which we provide new and non-standard estimates). As a consequence,
   the long time behaviour is determined by the principal eigenfunction or
   ground state. Based on this, we discuss (rigorously and via numerical
   explorations) the conditions on the fitness function and the mutation
   parameter for evolutionary branching to occur.},

Abstract = {Mountain regions are unusually biodiverse, with rich aggregations of
   small-ranged species that form centers of endemism. Mountains play an
   array of roles for Earth's biodiversity and affect neighboring lowlands
   through biotic interchange, changes in regional climate, and nutrient
   runoff. The high biodiversity of certain mountains reflects the
   interplay of multiple evolutionary mechanisms: enhanced speciation rates
   with distinct opportunities for coexistence and persistence of lineages,
   shaped by long-term climatic changes interacting with topographically
   dynamic landscapes. High diversity in most tropical mountains is tightly
   linked to bedrock geology-notably, areas comprising mafic and ultramafic
   lithologies, rock types rich in magnesium and poor in phosphate that
   present special requirements for plant physiology. Mountain biodiversity
   bears the signature of deep-time evolutionary and ecological processes,
   a history well worth preserving.},

Title = {Machine Learning Approximation Algorithms for High-Dimensional Fully

Abstract = {High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) appear in a
   number of models from the financial industry, such as in derivative
   pricing models, credit valuation adjustment models, or portfolio
   optimization models. The PDEs in such applications are high-dimensional
   as the dimension corresponds to the number of financial assets in a
   portfolio. Moreover, such PDEs are often fully nonlinear due to the need
   to incorporate certain nonlinear phenomena in the model such as default
   risks, transaction costs, volatility uncertainty (Knightian
   uncertainty), or trading constraints in the model. Such high-dimensional
   fully nonlinear PDEs are exceedingly difficult to solve as the
   computational effort for standard approximation methods grows
   exponentially with the dimension. In this work, we propose a new method
   for solving high-dimensional fully nonlinear second-order PDEs. Our
   method can in particular be used to sample from high-dimensional
   nonlinear expectations. The method is based on (1) a connection between
   fully nonlinear second-order PDEs and second-order backward stochastic
   differential equations (2BSDEs), (2) a merged formulation of the PDE and
   the 2BSDE problem, (3) a temporal forward discretization of the 2BSDE
   and a spatial approximation via deep neural nets, and (4) a stochastic
   gradient descent-type optimization procedure. Numerical results obtained
   using TensorFlow in Python illustrate the efficiency and the accuracy of
   the method in the cases of a 100-dimensional Black-Scholes-Barenblatt
   equation, a 100-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and a
   nonlinear expectation of a 100-dimensional G-Brownian motion.},

Abstract = {Parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) and backward stochastic
   differential equations (BSDEs) are key ingredients in a number of models
   in physics and financial engineering. In particular, parabolic PDEs and
   BSDEs are fundamental tools in pricing and hedging models for financial
   derivatives. The PDEs and BSDEs appearing in such applications are often
   high-dimensional and nonlinear. Since explicit solutions of such PDEs
   and BSDEs are typically not available, it is a very active topic of
   research to solve such PDEs and BSDEs approximately. In the recent
   article (E et al., Multilevel Picard iterations for solving smooth
   semilinear parabolic heat equations, arXiv:1607.03295) we proposed a
   family of approximation methods based on Picard approximations and
   multilevel Monte Carlo methods and showed under suitable regularity
   assumptions on the exact solution of a semilinear heat equation that the
   computational complexity is bounded by O(d mml:mspace width=0.166667em
   mml:mspace epsilon-(4+)) for any (0,) where d is the dimensionality of
   the problem and epsilon(0,) is the prescribed accuracy. In this paper,
   we test the applicability of this algorithm on a variety of
   100-dimensional nonlinear PDEs that arise in physics and finance by
   means of numerical simulations presenting approximation accuracy against
   runtime. The simulation results for many of these 100-dimensional
   example PDEs are very satisfactory in terms of both accuracy and speed.
   Moreover, we also provide a review of other approximation methods for
   nonlinear PDEs and BSDEs from the scientific literature.},

Abstract = {Local adaptation and dispersal evolution are key evolutionary processes
   shaping the invasion dynamics of populations colonizing new
   environments. Yet their interaction is largely unresolved. Using a
   single-species population model along a one-dimensional environmental
   gradient, we show how local competition and dispersal jointly shape the
   eco-evolutionary dynamics and speed of invasion. From a focal
   introduction site, the generic pattern predicted by our model features a
   temporal transition from wave-like to pulsed invasion. Each regime is
   driven primarily by local adaptation, while the transition is caused by
   eco-evolutionary feedbacks mediated by dispersal. The interaction range
   and cost of dispersal arise as key factors of the duration and speed of
   each phase. Our results demonstrate that spatial eco-evolutionary
   feedbacks along environmental gradients can drive strong temporal
   variation in the rate and structure of population spread, and must be
   considered to better understand and forecast invasion rates and range
   dynamics.},

Title = {Grey Lotka-Volterra models with application to cryptocurrencies adoption},
Journal = {CHAOS SOLITONS \& FRACTALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {122},
Pages = {47-57},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The study uses grey Lotka-Volterra model (GLVM) of two and three
   dimensions for assessing the interaction between cryptocurrencies. The
   2-dimensional study is on Bitcoin and Litecoin while the 3-dimensional
   study is on Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple. Records from 28-April-2013 to
   10-February-2018 provide forecasting values for Bitcoin and Litecoin
   through 2-dimensional GLVM study, while records from 7-August-2013 to
   10-February-2018 provide forecasting values of Bitcoin, Litecoin and
   Ripple through 3-dimensional GLVM study. The behaviour of Bitcoin and
   Litecoin or both Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple in future is proposed by
   looking at the 100 last forecasting values of n-dimensional GLVM study,
   n = \{2, 3\}. Lyapunov exponents of the 2 and 3-dimensional
   Lotka-Volterra models reveals that it is a chaotic dynamical system.
   Plots of 2 and 3-dimensional Lotka-Volterra models for filtered datasets
   suggest also a chaos. Using the mean absolute percentage error
   criterion, it was found that the accuracy of the GLVM is better than
   that of the grey model (GM(1,1)). By analysing the 2-dimensional GLVM,
   Bitcoin and Litecoin are found in the competition known as mutualism or
   equivalently a win-win situation where Bitcoin transaction is constant
   while Litecoin transaction has the increasing trend. The 3-dimensional
   GLVM analysis evokes however, an increasing trend in transacting both
   Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple where Bitcoin keep relatively higher
   transaction counts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Population structure determines the tradeoff between fixation
   probability and fixation time},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Month = {APR 23},
Abstract = {The rate of biological evolution depends on the fixation probability and
   on the fixation time of new mutants. Intensive research has focused on
   identifying population structures that augment the fixation probability
   of advantageous mutants. But these amplifiers of natural selection
   typically increase fixation time. Here we study population structures
   that achieve a tradeoff between fixation probability and time. First, we
   show that no amplifiers can have an asymptotically lower absorption time
   than the well-mixed population. Then we design population structures
   that substantially augment the fixation probability with just a minor
   increase in fixation time. Finally, we show that those structures enable
   higher effective rate of evolution than the well-mixed population
   provided that the rate of generating advantageous mutants is relatively
   low. Our work sheds light on how population structure affects the rate
   of evolution. Moreover, our structures could be useful for lab-based,
   medical, or industrial applications of evolutionary optimization.},

Title = {Inferring community assembly processes from macroscopic patterns using
   dynamic eco-evolutionary models and Approximate Bayesian Computation
   (ABC)},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {450-460},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Statistical techniques exist for inferring community assembly processes
   from community patterns. Habitat filtering, competition, and
   biogeographical effects have, for example, been inferred from signals in
   phenotypic and phylogenetic data. The usefulness of current inference
   techniques is, however, debated as a mechanistic and causal link between
   process and pattern is often lacking, and evolutionary processes and
   trophic interactions are ignored. Here, we revisit the current knowledge
   on community assembly across scales and, in line with several reviews
   that have outlined challenges associated with current inference
   techniques, we identify a discrepancy between the current paradigm of
   eco-evolutionary community assembly and current inference techniques
   that focus mainly on competition and habitat filtering. We argue that
   trait-based dynamic eco-evolutionary models in combination with recently
   developed model fitting and model evaluation techniques can provide
   avenues for more accurate, reliable, and inclusive inference. To
   exemplify, we implement a trait-based, spatially explicit
   eco-evolutionary model and discuss steps of model modification, fitting,
   and evaluation as an iterative approach enabling inference from diverse
   data sources. Through a case study on inference of prey and predator
   niche width in an eco-evolutionary context, we demonstrate how inclusive
   and mechanistic approaches-eco-evolutionary modelling and Approximate
   Bayesian Computation (ABC)-can enable inference of assembly processes
   that have been largely neglected by traditional techniques despite the
   ubiquity of such processes. Much literature points to the limitations of
   current inference techniques, but concrete solutions to such limitations
   are few. Many of the challenges associated with novel inference
   techniques are, however, already to some extent resolved in other fields
   and thus ready to be put into action in a more formal way for inferring
   processes of community assembly from signals in various data sources.},

Title = {Ecosystem function in predator-prey food webs-confronting dynamic models
   with empirical data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {88},
Number = {2},
Pages = {196-210},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Most ecosystem functions and related services involve species
   interactions across trophic levels, for example, pollination and
   biological pest control. Despite this, our understanding of ecosystem
   function in multitrophic communities is poor, and research has been
   limited to either manipulation in small communities or statistical
   descriptions in larger ones. Recent advances in food web ecology may
   allow us to overcome the trade-off between mechanistic insight and
   ecological realism. Molecular tools now simplify the detection of
   feeding interactions, and trait-based approaches allow the application
   of dynamic food web models to real ecosystems. We performed the first
   test of an allometric food web model's ability to replicate temporally
   nonaggregated abundance data from the field and to provide mechanistic
   insight into the function of predation. We aimed to reproduce and
   explore the drivers of the population dynamics of the aphid herbivore
   Rhopalosiphum padi observed in ten Swedish barley fields. We used a
   dynamic food web model, taking observed interactions and abundances of
   predators and alternative prey as input data, allowing us to examine the
   role of predation in aphid population control. The inverse problem
   methods were used for simultaneous model fit optimization and model
   parameterization. The model captured >70\% of the variation in aphid
   abundance in five of ten fields, supporting the model-embodied
   hypothesis that body size can be an important determinant of predation
   in the arthropod community. We further demonstrate how in-depth model
   analysis can disentangle the likely drivers of function, such as the
   community's abundance and trait composition. Analysing the variability
   in model performance revealed knowledge gaps, such as the source of
   episodic aphid mortality, and general method development needs that, if
   addressed, would further increase model success and enable stronger
   inference about ecosystem function. The results demonstrate that
   confronting dynamic food web models with abundance data from the field
   is a viable approach to evaluate ecological theory and to aid our
   understanding of function in real ecosystems. However, to realize the
   full potential of food web models, in ecosystem function research and
   beyond, trait-based parameterization must be refined and extended to
   include more traits than body size.},

Abstract = {Two network measures known as the economic complexity index (ECI) and
   product complexity index (PCI) have provided important insights into
   patterns of economic development. We show that the ECI and PCI are
   equivalent to a spectral clustering algorithm that partitions a
   similarity graph into two parts. The measures are also closely related
   to various dimensionality reduction methods, such as diffusion maps and
   correspondence analysis. Our results shed new light on the ECI's
   empirical success in explaining cross-country differences in gross
   domestic product per capita and economic growth, which is often linked
   to the diversity of country export baskets. In fact, countries with high
   (low) ECI tend to specialize in high-PCI (low-PCI) products. We also
   find that the ECI and PCI uncover specialization patterns across U.S.
   states and U.K. regions.},

   standard feedforward neural networks (NNs) with the PDEs explicitly
   encoded into the NN using automatic differentiation, while the sum of
   the mean-squared PDE residuals and the mean-squared error in
   initial-boundary conditions is minimized with respect to the NN
   parameters. Here we extend PINNs to fractional PINNs (fPINNs) to solve
   space-time fractional advection-diffusion equations (fractional ADEs),
   and we study systematically their convergence, hence explaining both
   fPINNs and PINNs for the first time. Specifically, we demonstrate their
   accuracy and effectiveness in solving multidimensional forward and
   inverse problems with forcing terms whose values are only known at
   randomly scattered spatio-temporal coordinates (black-box (BB) forcing
   terms). A novel element of the fPINNs is the hybrid approach that we
   introduce for constructing the residual in the loss function using both
   automatic differentiation for the integer-order operators and numerical
   discretization for the fractional operators. This approach bypasses the
   difficulties stemming from the fact that automatic differentiation is
   not applicable to fractional operators because the standard chain rule
   in integer calculus is not valid in fractional calculus. To discretize
   the fractional operators, we employ the Griinwald-Letnikov (GL) formula
   in one-dimensional fractional ADEs and the vector GL formula in
   conjunction with the directional fractional Laplacian in two- and
   three-dimensional fractional ADEs.
   We first consider the one-dimensional fractional Poisson equation and
   compare the convergence of the fPINNs against the finite difference
   method (FDM). We present the solution convergence using both the mean
   L-2 error as well as the standard deviation due to sensitivity to NN
   parameter initializations. Using different GL formulas we observe
   first-, second-, and third-order convergence rates for small size
   training sets but the error saturates for larger training sets. We
   explain these results by analyzing the four sources of numerical errors
   due to discretization, sampling, NN approximation, and optimization. The
   total error decays monotonically (below 10(-5) for a third-order GL
   formula) but it saturates beyond that point due to the optimization
   error. We also analyze the relative balance between discretization and
   sampling errors and observe that the sampling size and the number of
   discretization points (auxiliary points) should be comparable to achieve
   the highest accuracy. As we increase the depth of the NN up to certain
   value, the mean error decreases and the standard deviation increases,
   whereas the width has essentially no effect unless its value is either
   too small or too large. We next consider time-dependent fractional ADEs
   and compare white-box (WB) and BB forcing. We observe that for the WB
   forcing, our results are similar to the aforementioned cases; however,
   for the BB forcing fPINNs outperform FDM. Subsequently, we consider
   multidimensional time-, space-, and space-time-fractional ADEs using the
   directional fractional Laplacian and we observe relative errors of
   10(-3) similar to 10(-4). Finally, we solve several inverse problems in
   one, two, and three dimensions to identify the fractional orders,
   diffusion coefficients, and transport velocities and obtain accurate
   results given proper initializations even in the presence of significant
   noise.},

Abstract = {Developing algorithms for solving high-dimensional partial differential
   equations (PDEs) has been an exceedingly difficult task for a long time,
   due to the notoriously difficult problem known as the ``curse of
   dimensionality.{''} This paper introduces a deep learning-based approach
   that can handle general high-dimensional parabolic PDEs. To this end,
   the PDEs are reformulated using backward stochastic differential
   equations and the gradient of the unknown solution is approximated by
   neural networks, very much in the spirit of deep reinforcement learning
   with the gradient acting as the policy function. Numerical results on
   examples including the nonlinear Black-Scholes equation, the
   Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and the Allen-Cahn equation suggest
   that the proposed algorithm is quite effective in high dimensions, in
   terms of both accuracy and cost. This opens up possibilities in
   economics, finance, operational research, and physics, by considering
   all participating agents, assets, resources, or particles together at
   the same time, instead of making ad hoc assumptions on their
   interrelationships.},

Title = {A dynamical systems approach to gross domestic product forecasting},
Journal = {NATURE PHYSICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Pages = {861+},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Models developed for gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecasting
   tend to be extremely complex, relying on a large number of variables and
   parameters. Such complexity is not always to the benefit of the accuracy
   of the forecast. Economic complexity constitutes a framework that builds
   on methods developed for the study of complex systems to construct
   approaches that are less demanding than standard macroeconomic ones in
   terms of data requirements, but whose accuracy remains to be
   systematically benchmarked. Here we develop a forecasting scheme that is
   shown to outperform the accuracy of the five year forecast issued by the
   International Monetary Fund (IMF) by more than 25\% on the available
   data. The model is based on effectively representing economic growth as
   a two-dimensional dynamical system, defined by GDP per capita and
   `fitness', a variable computed using only publicly available
   product-level export data. We show that forecasting errors produced by
   the method are generally predictable and are also uncorrelated to IMF
   errors, suggesting that our method is extracting information that is
   complementary to standard approaches. We believe that our findings are
   of a very general nature and we plan to extend our validations on larger
   datasets in future works.},

Title = {Is the sky the limit? On the expansion threshold of a species' range},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {More than 100 years after Grigg's influential analysis of species'
   borders, the causes of limits to species' ranges still represent a
   puzzle that has never been understood with clarity. The topic has become
   especially important recently as many scientists have become interested
   in the potential for species' ranges to shift in response to climate
   change D and yet nearly all of those studies fail to recognise or
   incorporate evolutionary genetics in a way that relates to theoretical
   developments. I show that range margins can be understood based on just
   two measurable parameters: (i) the fitness cost of dispersal D a measure
   of environmental heterogeneity D and (ii) the strength of genetic drift,
   which reduces genetic diversity. Together, these two parameters define
   an `expansion threshold': adaptation fails when genetic drift reduces
   genetic diversity below that required for adaptation to a heterogeneous
   environment. When the key parameters drop below this expansion threshold
   locally, a sharp range margin forms. When they drop below this threshold
   throughout the species' range, adaptation collapses everywhere,
   resulting in either extinction or formation of a fragmented
   metapopulation. Because the effects of dispersal differ fundamentally
   with dimension, the second parameter D the strength of genetic drift D
   is qualitatively different compared to a linear habitat. In
   two-dimensional habitats, genetic drift becomes effectively independent
   of selection. It decreases with `neighbourhood size' D the number of
   individuals accessible by dispersal within one generation. Moreover, in
   contrast to earlier predictions, which neglected evolution of genetic
   variance and/or stochasticity in two dimensions, dispersal into small
   marginal populations aids adaptation. This is because the reduction of
   both genetic and demographic stochasticity has a stronger effect than
   the cost of dispersal through increased maladaptation. The expansion
   threshold thus provides a novel, theoretically justified, and testable
   prediction for formation of the range margin and collapse of the
   species' range.},

Title = {Technology Evolution Prediction Using Lotka-Volterra Equations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {140},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {During the development planning of a new product, designers and
   entrepreneurs rely on the prediction of product performance to make
   business investment and design strategy decisions. Moore's law and the
   logistic S-curve model help make such predictions but suffer several
   drawbacks. In this paper, Lotka-Volterra equations are used to describe
   the interaction between a product (system technology) and the components
   and elements (component technologies) that are combined to form the
   product. The equations are simplified by a relationship table and
   maturation evaluation in a two-step process. The performance data of the
   system and its components over time are modeled by simplified
   Lotka-Volterra equations. The methods developed here allow designers,
   entrepreneurs, and policy makers to predict the performances of a
   product and its components quantitatively using the simplified
   Lotka-Volterra equations. The methods also shed light on the extent of
   performance impact from a specific module (component technology) on a
   product (system technology), which is valuable for identifying the key
   features of a product and for making outsourcing decisions. Smartphones
   are used as an example to demonstrate the two-step simplification
   process. The Lotka-Volterra model of technology evolution is validated
   by a case study of passenger airplanes and turbofan aero-engines. The
   case study shows that the data fitting and predictive performances of
   Lotka-Volterra equations exceed those of extant models.},

Abstract = {In this contribution, we develop a theoretical framework for linking
   microprocesses (i.e., population dynamics and evolution through natural
   selection) with macrophenomena (such as interconnectedness and
   modularity within an ecological system). This is achieved by developing
   a measure of interconnectedness for population distributions defined on
   a trait space (generalizing the notion of modularity on graphs), in
   combination with an evolution equation for the population distribution.
   With this contribution, we provide a platform for understanding under
   what environmental, ecological, and evolutionary conditions ecosystems
   evolve toward being more or less modular. A major contribution of this
   work is that we are able to decompose the overall driver of changes at
   the macro level (such as interconnectedness) into three components: (i)
   ecologically driven change, (ii) evolutionarily driven change, and (iii)
   environmentally driven change.},

Title = {Dispersal in dendritic networks: Ecological consequences on the spatial
   distribution of population densities},

Abstract = {1. Understanding the consequences of spatial structure on ecological
   dynamics is a central theme in ecology. Recently, research has
   recognised the relevance of river and river-analogue network structures,
   because these systems are not only highly diverse but also rapidly
   changing due to habitat modifications or species invasions.
   2. Much of the previous work on ecological and evolutionary dynamics in
   metapopulations and metacommunities in dendritic river networks has been
   either using comparative approaches or was purely theoretical. However,
   the use of microcosm experiments provides the unique opportunity to
   study large-scale questions in a causal and experimental framework.
   3. We conducted replicated microcosm experiments, in which we
   manipulated the spatially explicit network configuration of a landscape
   and addressed how linear versus dendritic connectivity affects
   population dynamics, specifically the spatial distribution of population
   densities, and movement behaviour of the protist model organism
   Tetrahymena pyriformis. We tracked population densities and
   individual-level movement behaviour of thousands of individuals over
   time.
   4. At the end of the experiment, we found more variable population
   densities between patches in dendritic networks compared to linear
   networks, as predicted by theory. Specifically, in dendritic networks,
   population densities were higher at nodes that connected to headwaters
   compared to the headwaters themselves and to more central nodes in the
   network. These differences follow theoretical predictions and emerged
   from the different network topologies per se. These differences in
   population densities emerged despite weakly density-dependent movement.
   5. We show that differences in network structure alone can cause
   characteristic spatial variation in population densities. While such
   differences have been postulated by theoretical work and are the
   underlying precondition for differential dispersal evolution in
   heterogeneous networks, our results may be the first experimental
   demonstration thereof. Furthermore, these population-level dynamics may
   affect extinction risks and can upscale to previously shown
   metacommunity level diversity dynamics. Given that many species in
   natural river systems exhibit strong spatiotemporal patterns in
   population densities, our work suggests that abundance patterns should
   not only be addressed from a local environmental perspective, but may be
   the outcome of processes that are inherently driven by the respective
   habitat network structure.},

Title = {Mountain metacommunities: climate and spatial connectivity shape ant
   diversity in a complex landscape},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Understanding what drives biodiversity patterns across scales is a
   central goal of ecology. Both environmental gradients and spatial
   landscape structure have been found to be important factors influencing
   species distributions and community composition, and partly reflect the
   balance of underlying deterministic and stochastic community processes.
   In some systems, environmental gradients and spatial connectivity are
   intertwined in that steep environmental gradients serve as boundaries on
   species movements and impose environment-derived complex spatial
   structure to metacommunities. Mountainous landscapes are prime examples
   of this, and recent theory has linked principles of geomorphology,
   environmental gradients, and spatial structure to make predictions for
   resulting community patterns. In this context, we examine variation in
   taxonomic and phylogenetic ant diversity patterns along a geographic
   transect spanning > 5000 m in elevational range in the Hengduan
   mountains of southern China. We found that environmental gradients
   dominate variation in both alpha and beta diversity in this landscape,
   with alpha diversity strongly declining with elevation and beta
   diversity driven by elevational differences. However, within an
   elevational band spatial connectivity predicts beta diversity better
   than geographic distance. Our findings deviate from theoretical
   predictions in several ways, notably alpha diversity is monotonically
   declining and within-band beta diversity is invariant with increasing
   elevation. The discrepancies between theory and observation may be
   explained by differences in the Hengduan landscape from idealized
   fluvial landscapes, such as a lack of a mid-elevation peak in
   connectivity, as well as evolutionary limits on the source pool of
   species available to populate metacommunities at different elevations.
   The latter is supported by variation in phylogenetic community structure
   with elevation. Our results demonstrate the power of conceptual,
   statistical, and theoretical frameworks that integrate the roles of
   environment and spatial structure in metacommunities, but that
   additional work is needed to bridge the gap between abstract theory and
   real systems.},

Abstract = {We develop an algorithm for model selection which allows for the
   consideration of a combinatorially large number of candidate models
   governing a dynamical system. The innovation circumvents a disadvantage
   of standard model selection which typically limits the number of
   candidate models considered due to the intractability of computing
   information criteria. Using a recently developed sparse identification
   of nonlinear dynamics algorithm, the sub-selection of candidate models
   near the Pareto frontier allows feasible computation of Akaike
   information criteria (AIC) or Bayes information criteria scores for the
   remaining candidate models. The information criteria hierarchically
   ranks the most informative models, enabling the automatic and principled
   selection of the model with the strongest support in relation to the
   time-series data. Specifically, we show that AIC scores place each
   candidate model in the strong support, weak support or no support
   category. The method correctly recovers several canonical dynamical
   systems, including a susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered disease
   model, Burgers' equation and the Lorenz equations, identifying the
   correct dynamical system as the only candidate model with strong
   support.},

Abstract = {The propagation of a beneficial mutation in a spatially extended
   population is usually studied using the phenomenological stochastic
   Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov (SFKPP) equation. We derive here
   an individual-based, stochastic model founded on the spatial Moran
   process where fluctuations are treated exactly. The mean-field
   approximation of this model leads to an equation that is different from
   the phenomenological FKPP equation. At small selection pressure, the
   front behavior can be mapped into a Brownian motion with drift, the
   properties of which can be derived from the microscopic parameters of
   the Moran model. Finally, we generalize the model to take into account
   dispersal kernels beyond migration to nearest neighbors. We show how the
   effective population size (which controls the noise amplitude) and the
   diffusion coefficient can both be computed from the dispersal kernel.},

Title = {Stochastic modeling and numerical simulation of gene regulatory networks
   with protein bursting},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Gene expression is inherently stochastic. Advanced single-cell
   microscopy techniques together with mathematical models for single gene
   expression led to important insights in elucidating the sources of
   intrinsic noise in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In addition to the
   finite size effects due to low copy numbers, translational bursting is a
   dominant source of stochasticity in cell scenarios involving few short
   lived mRNA transcripts with high translational efficiency (as is
   typically the case for prokaryotes), causing protein synthesis to occur
   in random bursts.
   In the context of gene regulation cascades, the Chemical Master Equation
   (CME) governing gene expression has in general no closed form solution,
   and the accurate stochastic simulation of the dynamics of complex gene
   regulatory networks is a major computational challenge. The CME
   associated to a single gene self regulatory motif has been previously
   approximated by a one dimensional time dependent partial integral
   differential equation (PIDE). However, to the best of our knowledge,
   multidimensional versions for such PIDE have not been developed yet.
   Here we propose a multidimensional PIDE model for regulatory networks
   involving multiple genes with self and cross regulations (in which genes
   can be regulated by different transcription factors) derived as the
   continuous counterpart of a CME with jump process. The model offers a
   reliable description of systems with translational bursting. In order to
   provide an efficient numerical solution, we develop a semilagrangian
   method to discretize the differential part of the PIDE, combined with a
   composed trapezoidal quadrature formula to approximate the integral
   term.
   We apply the model and numerical method to study sustained stochastic
   oscillations and the development of competence, a particular case of
   transient differentiation attained by certain bacterial cells under
   stress conditions. We found that the resulting probability distributions
   are distinguishable from those characteristic of other transient
   differentiation processes. In this way, they can be employed as markers
   or signatures that identify such phenomena from bacterial population
   experimental data, for instance. The computational efficiency of the
   semilagrangian method makes it suitable for purposes like model
   identification and parameter estimation from experimental data or, in
   combination with optimization routines, the design of gene regulatory
   networks under molecular noise. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Ecological communities in heterogeneous environments assemble through
   the combined effect of species interaction and migration. Understanding
   the effect of these processes on the community properties is central to
   ecology. Here we study these processes for a single community subject to
   migration from a pool of species, with population dynamics described by
   the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations. We derive exact results for
   the phase diagram describing the dynamical behaviors, and for the
   diversity and species abundance distributions. A phase transition is
   found from a phase where a unique globally attractive fixed point exists
   to a phase where multiple dynamical attractors exist, leading to
   history-dependent community properties. The model is shown to possess a
   symmetry that also establishes a connection with other well-known
   models.},

Volume = {189},

Abstract = {Spatial structure can decisively influence the way evolutionary
   processes unfold. To date, several methods have been used to study
   evolution in spatial systems, including population genetics,
   quantitative genetics, moment-closure approximations, and
   individual-based models. Here we extend the study of spatial
   evolutionary dynamics to eco-evolutionary models based on
   reaction-diffusion equations and adaptive dynamics. Specifically, we
   derive expressions for the strength of directional and
   stabilizing/disruptive selection that apply both in continuous space and
   to metacommunities with symmetrical dispersal between patches. For
   directional selection on a quantitative trait, this yields a way to
   integrate local directional selection across space and determine whether
   the trait value will increase or decrease. The robustness of this
   prediction is validated against quantitative genetics. For
   stabilizing/disruptive selection, we show that spatial heterogeneity
   always contributes to disruptive selection and hence always promotes
   evolutionary branching. The expression for directional selection is
   numerically very efficient and hence lends itself to simulation studies
   of evolutionary community assembly. We illustrate the application and
   utility of the expressions for this purpose with two examples of the
   evolution of resource utilization. Finally, we outline the domain of
   applicability of reaction-diffusion equations as a modeling framework
   and discuss their limitations.},

Title = {Reviews and syntheses: parameter identification in marine planktonic

Abstract = {To describe the underlying processes involved in oceanic plankton
   dynamics is crucial for the determination of energy and mass flux
   through an ecosystem and for the estimation of biogeochemical element
   cycling. Many planktonic ecosystem models were developed to resolve
   major processes so that flux estimates can be derived from numerical
   simulations. These results depend on the type and number of
   parameterizations incorporated as model equations. Furthermore, the
   values assigned to respective parameters specify a model's solution.
   Representative model results are those that can explain data; therefore,
   data assimilation methods are utilized to yield optimal estimates of
   parameter values while fitting model results to match data. Central
   difficulties are (1) planktonic ecosystem models are imperfect and (2)
   data are often too sparse to constrain all model parameters. In this
   review we explore how problems in parameter identification are
   approached in marine planktonic ecosystem modelling.
   We provide background information about model uncertainties and
   estimation methods, and how these are considered for assessing misfits
   between observations and model results. We explain differences in
   evaluating uncertainties in parameter estimation, thereby also
   discussing issues of parameter identifiability. Aspects of model
   complexity are addressed and we describe how results from
   cross-validation studies provide much insight in this respect. Moreover,
   approaches are discussed that consider time- and space-dependent
   parameter values. We further discuss the use of dynamical/statistical
   emulator approaches, and we elucidate issues of parameter identification
   in global biogeochemical models. Our review discloses many facets of
   parameter identification, as we found many commonalities between the
   objectives of different approaches, but scientific insight differed
   between studies. To learn more from results of planktonic ecosystem
   models we recommend finding a good balance in the level of
   sophistication between mechanistic modelling and statistical data
   assimilation treatment for parameter estimation.},

   state-of-art and prospects},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Macroecology and biogeography are concerned with understanding
   biodiversity patterns across space and time. In the past, the two
   disciplines have addressed this question mainly with correlative
   approaches, despite frequent calls for more mechanistic explanations.
   Recent advances in computational power, theoretical understanding, and
   statistical tools are, however, currently facilitating the development
   of more system-oriented, mechanistic models. We review these models,
   identify different model types and theoretical frameworks, compare their
   processes and properties, and summarize emergent findings. We show that
   ecological (physiology, demographics, dispersal, biotic interactions)
   and evolutionary processes, as well as environmental and human-induced
   drivers, are increasingly modelled mechanistically; and that new
   insights into biodiversity dynamics emerge from these models. Yet,
   substantial challenges still lie ahead for this young research field.
   Among these, we identify scaling, calibration, validation, and balancing
   complexity as pressing issues. Moreover, particular process combinations
   are still understudied, and so far models tend to be developed for
   specific applications. Future work should aim at developing more
   flexible and modular models that not only allow different ecological
   theories to be expressed and contrasted, but which are also built for
   tight integration with all macroecological data sources. Moving the
   field towards such a systems macroecology' will test and improve our
   understanding of the causal pathways through which eco-evolutionary
   processes create diversity patterns across spatial and temporal scales.},

Abstract = {Populations that experience severe stress may avoid extinction through
   adaptation by natural selection. This process is called evolutionary
   rescue and has been studied under different names in medicine,
   agriculture, and conservation biology. It is a component of the emerging
   field of eco-evolutionary dynamics, which investigates how the
   ecological attributes of species may evolve rapidly under strong
   selection. Its distinguishing feature is to combine the evolutionary
   concept of relative fitness with the ecological concept of absolute
   fitness in a synthetic theory of persistent adaptation. The likelihood
   of rescue will depend both on attributes of the population, particularly
   abundance and variation, and on properties of the environment,
   particularly the rate and severity of deterioration. Medical
   interventions (e.g., the administration of antibiotics), agricultural
   practices (e.g., the application of pesticides), and population ecology
   (e.g., the effects of species introductions) provide numerous examples
   of evolutionary rescue. The general theory of rescue has been tested in
   laboratory experiments with microbes, in which experimental evolution
   shows how different treatments affect the frequency of rescue. Overall,
   these experiments have supported the predictions of general theory: In
   particular, abundance, variation, and dispersal have pronounced and
   repeatable effects on the rescue of populations and communities.
   Extending these laboratory results to the field is a major task for
   future research.},

Title = {Global existence and asymptotic behavior of solutions to a nonlocal
   Fisher-KPP type problem},

Abstract = {In this work, we consider a nonlocal Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion
   problem with Neumann boundary condition and nonnegative initial data in
   a bounded domain in R-n (n >= 1), with reaction term u(alpha)(1 - m(t)),
   where m(t) is the total mass at time t. With the help of Pohozaev's
   identity, the non-existence of nontrivial stationary solutions with
   Dirichlet boundary conditions is being shown. When alpha >= 1 and the
   initial mass is greater than or equal to one, the problem has
   nonnegative classical solutions. While if the initial mass is less than
   one, then the problem admits global solutions for n = 1, 2 with any 1 <=
   alpha < 2 or n >= 3 with any 1 <= alpha < 1 + 2/n. Moreover, the
   asymptotic convergence to the solution of the heat equation is proved.

Title = {Loss of habitat and connectivity erodes species diversity, ecosystem

Abstract = {Habitat loss fragments metacommunities, altering the movement of species
   between previously connected habitat patches. The consequences of
   habitat loss for ecosystem functioning depend, in part, on how these
   changes in connectivity alter the spatial insurance effects of
   biodiversity. Spatial insurance is the maintenance of biodiversity and
   stable ecosystem functioning in changing environments that occurs when
   species are able to move between local habitat patches in order to track
   conditions to which they are adapted. Spatial insurance requires a
   combination of species sorting dynamics, which allow species to disperse
   to habitats where they are productive, and mass effect dynamics, where
   dispersal allows species to persist in marginal habitats where
   environmental conditions do not support growth. Here we use a spatially
   explicit metacommunity model to show that the relative contribution of
   species sorting and mass effects to spatial insurance changes with the
   rate of dispersal. We then simulate different sequences of habitat loss
   by removing habitat patches based on their betweenness centrality (the
   degree to which a patch serves as a connection between other patches in
   the metacommunity). We demonstrate that the sequence of habitat loss has
   a large, non-linear impact on diversity, ecosystem functioning and
   stability. Spatial insurance is lost because habitat fragmentation
   impedes species sorting, while promoting mass effects and dispersal
   limitation. We find that species sorting dynamics, and thus spatial
   insurance, are most robust to the removal of habitat patches with low
   betweenness centrality. These findings advance our understanding of how
   habitat connectivity facilitates the maintenance of biodiversity and
   ecosystem functioning, and may prove useful for the design of habitat
   networks.},

Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {How should we model evolution in spatially structured populations? Here,
   I review an evolutionary ecology approach based on the technique of
   spatial moment equations. I first provide a mathematical underpinning to
   the derivation of equations for the densities of various spatial
   configurations in network-based models. I then show how this spatial
   ecological framework can be coupled with an adaptive dynamics approach
   to compute the invasion fitness of a rare mutant in a resident
   population at equilibrium. Under the additional assumption that
   mutations have small phenotypic effects, I show that the selection
   gradient can be expressed as a function of neutral measures of genetic
   and demographic structure. I discuss the connections between this
   approach and inclusive fitness theory, as well as the applicability and
   limits of this technique. My main message is that spatial moment
   equations can be used as a means to obtain compact qualitative arguments
   about the evolution of life-history traits for a variety of life cycles.

Title = {Stability and complexity in model meta-ecosystems},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The diversity of life and its organization in networks of interacting
   species has been a long-standing theoretical puzzle for ecologists. Ever
   since May's provocative paper challenging whether `large complex systems
   {[}are] stable' various hypotheses have been proposed to explain when
   stability should be the rule, not the exception. Spatial dynamics may be
   stabilizing and thus explain high community diversity, yet existing
   theory on spatial stabilization is limited, preventing comparisons of
   the role of dispersal relative to species interactions. Here we
   incorporate dispersal of organisms and material into
   stability-complexity theory. We find that stability criteria from
   classic theory are relaxed in direct proportion to the number of
   ecologically distinct patches in the meta-ecosystem. Further, we find
   the stabilizing effect of dispersal is maximal at intermediate
   intensity. Our results highlight how biodiversity can be vulnerable to
   factors, such as landscape fragmentation and habitat loss, that isolate
   local communities.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Although competition in the marketplace is inherently dynamic and firms
   change their competitive behavior over time, firms' competitive struggle
   is generally described using autonomous Lotka-Volterra (LV) models. A
   great limitation of autonomous LV systems is that the interaction
   coefficients are constant, and hence firms are assumed to have constant
   competitive strategies. Also, the solutions of LV models are generally
   unknown. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a class of
   integrable nonautonomous LV models. Our LV models present some relevant
   advantages. First, the analytical solutions of this system are known,
   therefore we no longer need to fit the LV coefficients. Second, the
   analytical solutions only depend on the utility functions of the
   competing firms. Third, our model has a strong connection with the logit
   model. As mainstream economics extensively use the logit model to
   describe market demand, our approach has solid economic foundations. In
   the second part of the article, we test the performance of our approach
   by studying two cases in competition economics. We find that our model
   has a better ability to describe and forecast market evolution than the
   LV autonomous models proposed in the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Modelling Population Dynamics in Realistic Landscapes with Linear
   Elements: A Mechanistic-Statistical Reaction-Diffusion Approach},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 17},
Abstract = {We propose and develop a general approach based on reaction-diffusion
   equations for modelling a species dynamics in a realistic
   two-dimensional (2D) landscape crossed by linear one-dimensional (1D)
   corridors, such as roads, hedgerows or rivers. Our approach is based on
   a hybrid ``2D/1D model{''}, i.e, a system of 2D and 1D
   reaction-diffusion equations with homogeneous coefficients, in which
   each equation describes the population dynamics in a given 2D or 1D
   element of the landscape. Using the example of the range expansion of
   the tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus in France and its main highways as
   1D corridors, we show that the model can be fitted to realistic
   observation data. We develop a mechanistic-statistical approach, based
   on the coupling between a model of population dynamics and a
   probabilistic model of the observation process. This allows us to bridge
   the gap between the data (3 levels of infestation, at the scale of a
   French department) and the output of the model (population densities at
   each point of the landscape), and to estimate the model parameter values
   using a maximum-likelihood approach. Using classical model comparison
   criteria, we obtain a better fit and a better predictive power with the
   2D/1D model than with a standard homogeneous reaction-diffusion model.
   This shows the potential importance of taking into account the effect of
   the corridors (highways in the present case) on species dynamics. With
   regard to the particular case of A. albopictus, the conclusion that
   highways played an important role in species range expansion in mainland
   France is consistent with recent findings from the literature.},

Abstract = {Four decades ago, Leigh Van Valen presented the Red Queen's hypothesis
   to account for evolution of species within a multispecies ecological
   community {[}Van Valen L (1973) Evol Theory 1(1):1-30]. The overall
   conclusion of Van Valen's analysis was that evolution would continue
   even in the absence of abiotic perturbations. Stenseth and Maynard Smith
   presented in 1984 {[}Stenseth NC, Maynard Smith J (1984) Evolution
   38(4): 870-880] a model for the Red Queen's hypothesis showing that both
   Red-Queen type of continuous evolution and stasis could result from a
   model with biotically driven evolution. However, although that
   contribution demonstrated that both evolutionary outcomes were possible,
   it did not identify which ecological conditions would lead to each of
   these evolutionary outcomes. Here, we provide, using a simple, yet
   general population-biologically founded eco-evolutionary model, such
   analytically derived conditions: Stasis will predominantly emerge
   whenever the ecological system contains only symmetric ecological
   interactions, whereas both Red-Queen and stasis type of evolution may
   result if the ecological interactions are asymmetrical, and more likely
   so with increasing degree of asymmetry in the ecological system (i.e.,
   the more trophic interactions, host-pathogen interactions, and the like
   there are {[}i.e., +/-type of ecological interactions as well as
   asymmetric competitive (-/-) and mutualistic (+/+) ecological
   interactions]). In the special case of no between-generational genetic
   variance, our results also predict dynamics within these types of purely
   ecological systems.},

Abstract = {We introduce the dynamical sine-Gordon equation in two space dimensions

   regularity structures {[}Hairer, Invent Math 198(2):269-504, 2014]. We
   also show that this model arises naturally from a class of -dimensional
   equilibrium interface fluctuation models with periodic nonlinearities.
   The main mathematical difficulty arises in the construction of the model
   for the associated regularity structure where the role of the noise is
   played by a non-Gaussian random distribution similar to the complex
   multiplicative Gaussian chaos recently analysed in Lacoin et al.

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Genetic data often exhibit patterns broadly consistent with `isolation
   by distance'-a phenomenon where genetic similarity decays with
   geographic distance. In a heterogeneous habitat, this may occur more
   quickly in some regions than in others: for example, barriers to gene
   flow can accelerate differentiation between neighboring groups. We use
   the concept of `effective migration' to model the relationship between
   genetics and geography. In this paradigm, effective migration is low in
   regions where genetic similarity decays quickly. We present a method to
   visualize variation in effective migration across a habitat from
   geographically indexed genetic data. Our approach uses a population
   genetic model to relate effective migration rates to expected genetic
   dissimilarities. We illustrate its potential and limitations using
   simulations and data from elephant, human and Arabidopsis thaliana
   populations. The resulting visualizations highlight important spatial
   features of population structure that are difficult to discern using
   existing methods for summarizing genetic variation.},

Title = {Stochastic dynamics of adaptive trait and neutral marker driven by

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {71},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1211-1242},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {How the neutral diversity is affected by selection and adaptation is
   investigated in an eco-evolutionary framework. In our model, we study a
   finite population in continuous time, where each individual is
   characterized by a trait under selection and a completely linked neutral
   marker. Population dynamics are driven by births and deaths, mutations
   at birth, and competition between individuals. Trait values influence
   ecological processes (demographic events, competition), and competition
   generates selection on trait variation, thus closing the
   eco-evolutionary feedback loop. The demographic effects of the trait are
   also expected to influence the generation and maintenance of neutral
   variation. We consider a large population limit with rare mutation,
   under the assumption that the neutral marker mutates faster than the
   trait under selection. We prove the convergence of the stochastic
   individual-based process to a new measure-valued diffusive process with
   jumps that we call Substitution Fleming-Viot Process (SFVP). When
   restricted to the trait space this process is the Trait Substitution
   Sequence first introduced by Metz et al. (1996). During the invasion of
   a favorable mutation, a genetical bottleneck occurs and the marker
   associated with this favorable mutant is hitchhiked. By rigorously
   analysing the hitchhiking effect and how the neutral diversity is
   restored afterwards, we obtain the condition for a time-scale
   separation; under this condition, we show that the marker distribution
   is approximated by a Fleming-Viot distribution between two trait
   substitutions. We discuss the implications of the SFVP for our
   understanding of the dynamics of neutral variation under
   eco-evolutionary feedbacks and illustrate the main phenomena with
   simulations. Our results highlight the joint importance of mutations,
   ecological parameters, and trait values in the restoration of neutral
   diversity after a selective sweep.},

   Economic theory predicts that positive agglomeration economies may be

   technological classes in the short term. The empirical analysis exploits
   the panel structure of the dataset to account for various fixed effects,
   and adopts an instrumental variable approach to prove causality. The
   results show that the effect is overall positive and stronger with a
   time lag. In addition, the effect is not bounded within narrow
   technological categories, suggesting that Jacob-type knowledge
   spillovers across sectors tend to prevail over other source of
   agglomeration economies within sectors, including sharing and matching
   mechanisms. The implications for local development policy are discussed.},

Abstract = {Why do species not adapt to ever-wider ranges of conditions, gradually
   expanding their ecological niche and geographic range? Gene flow across
   environments has two conflicting effects: although it increases genetic
   variation, which is a prerequisite for adaptation, gene flow may swamp
   adaptation to local conditions. In 1956, Haldane proposed that, when the
   environment varies across space, ``swamping{''} by gene flow creates a
   positive feedback between low population size and maladaptation, leading
   to a sharp range margin. However, current deterministic theory shows
   that, when variance can evolve, there is no such limit. Using simple
   analytical tools and simulations, we show that genetic drift can
   generate a sharp margin to a species' range, by reducing genetic
   variance below the level needed for adaptation to spatially variable
   conditions. Aided by separation of ecological and evolutionary
   timescales, the identified effective dimensionless parameters reveal a
   simple threshold that predicts when adaptation at the range margin
   fails. Two observable parameters determine the threshold: (i) the
   effective environmental gradient, which can be measured by the loss of
   fitness due to dispersal to a different environment; and (ii) the
   efficacy of selection relative to genetic drift. The theory predicts
   sharp range margins even in the absence of abrupt changes in the
   environment. Furthermore, it implies that gradual worsening of
   conditions across a species' habitat may lead to a sudden range
   fragmentation, when adaptation to a wide span of conditions within a
   single species becomes impossible.},

Title = {The Heterogeneous Dynamics of Economic Complexity},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 11},
Abstract = {What will be the growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or the
   competitiveness of China, United States, and Vietnam in the next 3, 5 or
   10 years? Despite this kind of questions has a large societal impact and
   an extreme value for economic policy making, providing a scientific
   basis for economic predictability is still a very challenging problem.
   Recent results of a new branch-Economic Complexity-have set the basis
   for a framework to approach such a challenge and to provide new
   perspectives to cast economic prediction into the conceptual scheme of
   forecasting the evolution of a dynamical system as in the case of
   weather dynamics. We argue that a recently introduced non-monetary
   metrics for country competitiveness ( fitness) allows for quantifying
   the hidden growth potential of countries by the means of the comparison
   of this measure for intangible assets with monetary figures, such as GDP
   per capita. This comparison defines the fitness-income plane where we
   observe that country dynamics presents strongly heterogeneous patterns
   of evolution. The flow in some zones is found to be laminar while in
   others a chaotic behavior is instead observed. These two regimes
   correspond to very different predictability features for the evolution
   of countries: in the former regime, we find strong predictable pattern
   while the latter scenario exhibits a very low predictability. In such a
   framework, regressions, the usual tool used in economics, are no more
   the appropriate strategy to deal with such a heterogeneous scenario and
   new concepts, borrowed from dynamical systems theory, are mandatory. We
   therefore propose a data-driven method-the selective predictability
   scheme-in which we adopt a strategy similar to the methods of analogues,
   firstly introduced by Lorenz, to assess future evolution of countries.},

Abstract = {The interactions between organisms and their environments can shape
   distributions of spatial genetic variation, resulting in patterns of
   isolation by environment (IBE) in which genetic and environmental
   distances are positively correlated, independent of geographic distance.
   IBE represents one of the most important patterns that results from the
   ways in which landscape heterogeneity influences gene flow and
   population connectivity, but it has only recently been examined in
   studies of ecological and landscape genetics. Nevertheless, the study of
   IBE presents valuable opportunities to investigate how spatial
   heterogeneity in ecological processes, agents of selection and
   environmental variables contributes to genetic divergence in nature. New
   and increasingly sophisticated studies of IBE in natural systems are
   poised to make significant contributions to our understanding of the
   role of ecology in genetic divergence and of modes of differentiation
   both within and between species. Here, we describe the underlying
   ecological processes that can generate patterns of IBE, examine its
   implications for a wide variety of disciplines and outline several areas
   of future research that can answer pressing questions about the
   ecological basis of genetic diversity.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {11},
Number = {100},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {The stability analysis of socioeconomic systems has been centred on
   answering whether small perturbations when a system is in a given
   quantitative state will push the system permanently to a different
   quantitative state. However, typically the quantitative state of
   socioeconomic systems is subject to constant change. Therefore, a key
   stability question that has been under-investigated is how strongly the
   conditions of a system itself can change before the system moves to a
   qualitatively different behaviour, i.e. how structurally stable the
   systems is. Here, we introduce a framework to investigate the structural
   stability of socioeconomic systems formed by a network of interactions
   among agents competing for resources. We measure the structural
   stability of the system as the range of conditions in the distribution
   and availability of resources compatible with the qualitative behaviour
   in which all the constituent agents can be self-sustained across time.
   To illustrate our framework, we study an empirical representation of the
   global socioeconomic system formed by countries sharing and competing
   for multinational companies used as proxy for resources. We demonstrate
   that the structural stability of the system is inversely associated with
   the level of competition and the level of heterogeneity in the
   distribution of resources. Importantly, we show that the qualitative
   behaviour of the observed global socioeconomic system is highly
   sensitive to changes in the distribution of resources. We believe that
   this work provides a methodological basis to develop sustainable
   strategies for socioeconomic systems subject to constantly changing
   conditions.},

Abstract = {The relative importance of contemporary and historical processes is
   central for understanding biodiversity patterns. While several studies
   show that past conditions can partly explain the current biodiversity
   patterns, the role of history remains elusive. We reconstructed
   palaeo-drainage basins under lower sea level conditions (Last Glacial
   Maximum) to test whether the historical connectivity between basins left
   an imprint on the global patterns of freshwater fish biodiversity. After
   controlling for contemporary and past environmental conditions, we found
   that palaeo-connected basins displayed greater species richness but
   lower levels of endemism and beta diversity than did palaeo-disconnected
   basins. Palaeo-connected basins exhibited shallower distance decay of
   compositional similarity, suggesting that palaeo-river connections
   favoured the exchange of fish species. Finally, we found that a longer
   period of palaeo-connection resulted in lower levels of beta diversity.
   These findings reveal the first unambiguous results of the role played
   by history in explaining the global contemporary patterns of
   biodiversity.},

   from widespread evidence supporting positive relationships, negative and
   hump-shaped relationships have also been reported. In a meta-analysis of
   1148 data points from 192 studies worldwide, we examine the strength and
   direction of the relationship between spatial environmental
   heterogeneity and species richness of terrestrial plants and animals. We
   find that separate effects of heterogeneity in land cover, vegetation,
   climate, soil and topography are significantly positive, with vegetation
   and topographic heterogeneity showing particularly strong associations
   with species richness. The use of equal-area study units, spatial grain
   and spatial extent emerge as key factors influencing the strength of
   heterogeneity-richness relationships, highlighting the pervasive
   influence of spatial scale in heterogeneity-richness studies. We provide
   the first quantitative support for the generality of positive
   heterogeneity-richness relationships across heterogeneity components,
   habitat types, taxa and spatial scales from landscape to global extents,
   and identify specific needs for future comparative
   heterogeneity-richness research.},

Abstract = {River networks define ecological corridors characterised by
   unidirectional streamflow, which may impose downstream drift to aquatic
   organisms or affect their movement. Animals and plants manage to persist
   in riverine ecosystems, though, which in fact harbour high biological
   diversity. Here, we study metapopulation persistence in river networks
   analysing stage-structured populations that exploit different dispersal
   pathways, both along-stream and overland. Using stability analysis, we
   derive a novel criterion for metapopulation persistence in arbitrarily
   complex landscapes described as spatial networks. We show how dendritic
   geometry and overland dispersal can promote population persistence, and
   that their synergism provides an explanation of the so-called `drift
   paradox'. We also study the geography of the initial spread of a species
   and place it in the context of biological invasions. Applications
   concerning the persistence of stream salamanders in the Shenandoah
   river, and the spread of two invasive species in the
   Mississippi-Missouri are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Local adaptation has been a major focus of evolutionary ecologists
   working across diverse systems for decades. However, little of this
   research has explored variation at microgeographic scales because it has
   often been assumed that high rates of gene flow will prevent adaptive
   divergence at fine spatial scales. Here, we establish a quantitative
   definition of microgeographic adaptation based on Wright's dispersal
   neighborhood that standardizes dispersal abilities, enabling this
   measure to be compared across species. We use this definition to
   evaluate growing evidence of evolutionary divergence at fine spatial
   scales. We identify the main mechanisms known to facilitate this
   adaptation and highlight illustrative examples of microgeographic
   evolution in nature. Collectively, this evidence requires that we
   revisit our understanding of the spatial scale of adaptation and
   consider how microgeographic adaptation and its driving mechanisms can
   fundamentally alter ecological and evolutionary dynamics in nature.},

Title = {Drivers of population genetic differentiation in the wild: isolation by
   dispersal limitation, isolation by adaptation and isolation by
   colonization},

Abstract = {Empirical population genetic studies have been dominated by a neutralist
   view, according to which gene flow and drift are the main forces driving
   population genetic structure in nature. The neutralist view in essence
   describes a process of isolation by dispersal limitation (IBDL) that
   generally leads to a pattern of isolation by distance (IBD). Recently,
   however, conceptual frameworks have been put forward that view local
   genetic adaptation as an important driver of population genetic
   structure. Isolation by adaptation (IBA) and monopolization (M) posit
   that gene flow among natural populations is reduced as a consequence of
   local genetic adaptation. IBA stresses that effective gene flow is
   reduced among habitats that show dissimilar ecological characteristics,
   leading to a pattern of isolation by environment. In monopolization,
   local genetic adaptation of initial colonizing genotypes results in a
   reduction in gene flow that fosters the persistence of founder effects.
   Here, we relate these different processes driving landscape genetic
   structure to patterns of IBD and isolation by environment (IBE). We
   propose a method to detect whether IBDL, IBA and M shape genetic
   differentiation in natural landscapes by studying patterns of variation
   at neutral and non-neutral markers as well as at ecologically relevant
   traits. Finally, we reinterpret a representative number of studies from
   the recent literature by associating patterns to processes and identify
   patterns associated with local genetic adaptation to be as common as
   IBDL in structuring regional genetic variation of populations in the
   wild. Our results point to the importance of quantifying environmental
   gradients and incorporating ecology in the analysis of population
   genetics.},

Abstract = {How do mutation and gene flow influence population persistence, niche
   expansion and local adaptation in spatially heterogeneous environments?
   In this article, we analyse a demographic and evolutionary model of
   adaptation to an environment containing two habitats in equal
   frequencies, and we bridge the gap between different theoretical
   frameworks. Qualitatively, our model yields four qualitative types of
   outcomes: (i) global extinction of the population, (ii) adaptation to
   one habitat only, but also adaptation to both habitats with, (iii)
   specialized phenotypes or (iv) with generalized phenotypes, and we
   determine the conditions under which each equilibrium is reached. We
   derive new analytical approximations for the local densities and the
   distributions of traits in each habitat under a
   migration-selection-mutation balance, compute the equilibrium values of
   the means, variances and asymmetries of the local distributions of
   phenotypes, and contrast the effects of migration and mutation on the
   evolutionary outcome. We then check our analytical results by solving
   our model numerically, and also assess their robustness in the presence
   of demographic stochasticity. Although increased migration results in a
   decrease in local adaptation, mutation in our model does not influence
   the values of the local mean traits. Yet, both migration and mutation
   can have dramatic effects on population size and even lead to
   metapopulation extinction when selection is strong. Niche expansion, the
   ability for the population to adapt to both habitats, can also be
   prevented by small migration rates and a reduced evolutionary potential
   characterized by rare mutation events of small effects; however, niche
   expansion is otherwise the most likely outcome. Although our results are
   derived under the assumption of clonal reproduction, we finally show and
   discuss the links between our model and previous quantitative genetics
   models.},

Abstract = {We investigate an individual-based model of adaptive radiation based on
   the biogeographical changes of the Great African Lakes where cichlid
   fishes radiated. In our model, the landscape consists of a mosaic of
   three habitat types which may or may not be separated by geographic
   barriers. We study the effect of the alternation between allopatry and
   sympatry called landscape dynamics. We show that landscape dynamics can
   generate a significantly higher diversity than allopatric or sympatric
   speciation alone. Diversification is mainly due to the joint action of
   allopatric, ecological divergence, and of disruptive selection
   increasing assortative mating and allowing for the coexistence in
   sympatry of species following reinforcement or character displacement.
   Landscape dynamics possibly increase diversity at each landscape change.
   The characteristics of the radiation depend on the speed of landscape
   dynamics and of the number of geographically isolated regions at steady
   state. Under fast dynamics of a landscape with many fragments, the model
   predicts a high diversity, possibly subject to the temporary collapse of
   all species into a hybrid swarm. When fast landscape dynamics induce the
   recurrent fusion of several sites, diversity is moderate but very stable
   over time. Under slow landscape dynamics, diversification proceeds
   similarly, although at a slower pace.},

Abstract = {Resistance to chemotherapies, particularly to anticancer treatments, is
   an increasing medical concern. Among the many mechanisms at work in
   cancers, one of the most important is the selection of tumor cells
   expressing resistance genes or phenotypes. Motivated by the theory of
   mutation-selection in adaptive evolution, we propose a model based on a
   continuous variable that represents the expression level of a resistance
   gene (or genes, yielding a phenotype) influencing in healthy and tumor
   cells birth/death rates, effects of chemotherapies (both cytotoxic and
   cytostatic) and mutations. We extend previous work by demonstrating how
   qualitatively different actions of chemotherapeutic and cytostatic
   treatments may induce different levels of resistance. The mathematical
   interest of our study is in the formalism of constrained Hamilton-Jacobi
   equations in the framework of viscosity solutions. We derive the
   long-term temporal dynamics of the fittest traits in the regime of small
   mutations. In the context of adaptive cancer management, we also analyse
   whether an optimal drug level is better than the maximal tolerated dose.},

Title = {A Finite Difference Scheme for Pricing American Put Options under Kou's
   Jump-Diffusion Model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FUNCTION SPACES AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2013},
Abstract = {We present a stable finite difference scheme on a piecewise uniform mesh
   along with a penalty method for pricing American put options under Kou's
   jump-diffusion model. By adding a penalty term, the partial
   integrodifferential complementarity problem arising from pricing
   American put options under Kou's jump-diffusion model is transformed
   into a nonlinear parabolic integrodifferential equation.. en a finite
   difference scheme is proposed to solve the penalized integrodifferential
   equation, which combines a central difference scheme on a piecewise
   uniform mesh with respect to the spatial variable with an
   implicit-explicit time stepping technique. This leads to the solution of
   problems with a tridiagonal M-matrix. It is proved that the difference
   scheme satisfies the early exercise constraint. Furthermore, it is
   proved that the scheme is oscillation-free and is second-order
   convergent with respect to the spatial variable.. e numerical results
   support the theoretical results.},

Title = {Quis Pendit Ipsa Pretia: Facebook Valuation and Diagnostic of a Bubble

Year = {2012},
Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Cauwels and Sornette present a novel methodology to determine the
   fundamental value of firms in the social networking sector, motivated by
   recent realized IPOs and by reports that suggest sky-high valuations of
   firms such as Facebook, Groupon, LinkedIn Corp., Pandora Media, Inc.,
   Twitter, and Zynga. The authors' valuation of these firms is based on
   two assumptions: 1) revenues and profits of a social networking firm are
   inherently linked to its user base through a direct channel that has no
   equivalent in other sectors, and 2) the growth in the number of users
   can be calibrated with standard logistic growth models, which allows for
   reliable extrapolations of the size of the business at long time
   horizons. Cauwels and Sornette illustrate the methodology with a
   detailed analysis of Facebook, one of the biggest of the social media
   giants. A clear signature of a change of regime, occurring in 2010 in
   the growth of the number of users, is observed. The change of regime is
   a move from a pure exponential behavior (a paradigm for unlimited
   growth) to a logistic function with asymptotic plateau (a paradigm for
   growth in competition). The authors consider three different scenarios:
   a base case, high-growth, and extreme-growth scenario. Using a discount
   factor of 5\%, a profit margin of 29\% and \$3.50 of revenues per user
   per year yields a value of Facebook of \$15.3 billion in the base case
   scenario, \$20.2 billion in the high-growth scenario, and \$32.9 billion
   in the extreme-growth scenario. According to the authors' methodology,
   this implies that Facebook needs to increase its profit per user before
   the IPO by a factor of 3 to 6 in the base case scenario, 2.5 to 5 in the
   high-growth scenario, and 1.5 to 3 in the extreme-growth scenario in
   order to meet the current, widespread high expectations. To prove the
   wider applicability of their methodology, the analysis is repeated for
   Groupon, the well-known deal-of-the-day website, that went public in
   November 2011. The results are in line with the Facebook analysis.
   Customer growth will plateau. By not taking this fundamental property of
   the growth process into consideration, estimates of the Facebook IPO are
   wildly overpriced.},

Title = {The Dynamics of Nestedness Predicts the Evolution of Industrial
   Ecosystems},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {In economic systems, the mix of products that countries make or export
   has been shown to be a strong leading indicator of economic growth.
   Hence, methods to characterize and predict the structure of the network
   connecting countries to the products that they export are relevant for
   understanding the dynamics of economic development. Here we study the
   presence and absence of industries in international and domestic
   economies and show that these networks are significantly nested. This
   means that the less filled rows and columns of these networks' adjacency
   matrices tend to be subsets of the fuller rows and columns. Moreover, we
   show that their nestedness remains constant over time and that it is
   sustained by both, a bias for industries that deviate from the networks'
   nestedness to disappear, and a bias for the industries that are missing
   according to nestedness to appear. This makes the appearance and
   disappearance of individual industries in each location predictable. We
   interpret the high level of nestedness observed in these networks in the
   context of the neutral model of development introduced by Hidalgo and
   Hausmann (2009). We show that the model can reproduce the high level of
   nestedness observed in these networks only when we assume a high level
   of heterogeneity in the distribution of capabilities available in
   countries and required by products. In the context of the neutral model,
   this implies that the high level of nestedness observed in these
   economic networks emerges as a combination of both, the complementarity
   of inputs and heterogeneity in the number of capabilities available in
   countries and required by products. The stability of nestedness in
   industrial ecosystems, and the predictability implied by it,
   demonstrates the importance of the study of network properties in the
   evolution of economic networks.},

   Our model includes three basic types: symbiosis with direct mutual
   interactions, symbiosis with asymmetric interactions, and symbiosis
   without direct interactions. In all cases, we provide a complete
   classification of all admissible dynamical regimes. The proposed model
   of symbiosis turned out to be very rich, as it exhibits four
   qualitatively different regimes: convergence to stationary states,
   unbounded exponential growth, finite-time singularity, and finite-time
   death or extinction of species. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Biological communities often occur in spatially structured habitats
   where connectivity directly affects dispersal and metacommunity
   processes. Recent theoretical work suggests that dispersal constrained
   by the connectivity of specific habitat structures, such as dendrites
   like river networks, can explain observed features of biodiversity, but
   direct evidence is still lacking. We experimentally show that
   connectivity per se shapes diversity patterns in microcosm
   metacommunities at different levels. Local dispersal in isotropic
   lattice landscapes homogenizes local species richness and leads to
   pronounced spatial persistence. On the contrary, dispersal along
   dendritic landscapes leads to higher variability in local diversity and
   among-community composition. Although headwaters exhibit relatively
   lower species richness, they are crucial for the maintenance of regional
   biodiversity. Our results establish that spatially constrained dendritic
   connectivity is a key factor for community composition and population
   persistence.},

   by the architecture of the spatial network, although this effect depends
   on demographic parameters here represented by the
   extinction-to-colonization ratio (e/c). Thus, for moderate to large
   e/c-values, regional abundance grows with the heterogeneity of the
   network, with uniform or random networks having the lowest regional
   abundances, and scale-free networks having the largest abundance.
   However, the ranking is reversed for low extinction probabilities, with
   heterogeneous networks showing the lowest relative abundance. We further
   explore the mechanisms underlying such results by relating a node's
   incidence (average number of time steps the node is occupied) with its
   degree, and with the average degree of the nodes it interacts with.
   These results demonstrate the importance of spatial network structure to
   understanding metapopulation abundance, and serve to determine under
   what circumstances information on network structure should be
   complemented with information on the species life-history traits to
   understand persistence in heterogeneous environments. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {This study is an overview of network topology metrics and a
   computational approach to analyzing graph topology via multiple-metric
   analysis on graph ensembles. The paper cautions against studying single
   metrics or combining disparate graph ensembles from different domains to
   extract global patterns. This is because there often exists considerable
   diversity among graphs that share any given topology metric, patterns
   vary depending on the underlying graph construction model, and many real
   data sets are not actual statistical ensembles. As real data examples,
   we present five airline ensembles, comprising temporal snapshots of
   networks of similar topology. Wikipedia language networks are shown as
   an example of a nontemporal ensemble. General patterns in metric
   correlations, as well as exceptions, are discussed by representing the
   data sets via hierarchically clustered correlation heat maps. Most
   topology metrics are not independent and their correlation patterns vary
   across ensembles. In general, density-related metrics and graph
   distance-based metrics cluster and the two groups are orthogonal to each
   other. Metrics based on degree-degree correlations have the highest
   variance across ensembles and cluster the different data sets on par
   with principal component analysis. Namely, the degree correlation, the s
   metric, their elasticities, and the rich club moments appear to be most
   useful in distinguishing topologies.},

Abstract = {There is a long tradition in population genetics of exploring the
   maintenance of variation under migration-selection balance using
   deterministic models that assume infinite population size. With finite
   population size, stochastic dynamics can greatly reduce the potential
   for the maintenance of polymorphism, but this has yet to be explored in
   detail. Here, classical two-patch models are extended to predict: (1)
   the probability of a locally beneficial mutation rising in frequency in
   the patch where it is favored and (2) the critical threshold migration
   rate above which the maintenance of polymorphism is much less likely.
   Individual-based simulations show that these approximations provide
   accurate predictions across a wide range of parameter space.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Biologists seek an understanding of the biological and environmental
   factors determining local community diversity. Recent advances in
   metacommunity ecology, and neutral theory in particular, highlight the
   importance of dispersal processes interacting with the spatial structure
   of a landscape for generating spatial patterns and maintaining
   biodiversity. The relative spatial isolation of a community is
   traditionally thought to have a large influence on local diversity.
   However, isolation remains an elusive concept to quantify, particularly
   in metacommunities with complex spatial structure. We represent the
   metacommunity as a network of local communities, and use network
   centrality measures to quantify the isolation of a local community.
   Using spatially explicit neutral theory, we examine how node position
   predicts variation in alpha diversity across a metacommunity. We find
   that diversity increases with node centrality in the network, but only
   when centrality is measured on a given scale in the network that widens
   with increasing dispersal rates and narrows with increasing evolutionary
   rates. More generally, complex biodiversity patterns form only when the
   underlying geography has structure on this critical scale. This provides
   a framework for understanding the influence of spatial geographic
   structure on global biodiversity patterns.},

Abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a ``mess,{''} given the
   seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns
   of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However,
   at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of
   species-the subject matter of community ecology-are influenced by only
   four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal.
   Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species,
   drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation
   creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across
   space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be
   understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes.
   Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their
   interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing
   the material of community ecology according to this framework can
   clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many
   conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also
   allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community
   dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal,
   and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift
   and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community
   dynamics.},

Abstract = {The mechanisms for the origin and maintenance of biological diversity
   are not fully understood. It is known that frequency-dependent
   selection, generating advantages for rare types, can maintain genetic
   variation and lead to speciation, but in models with simple phenotypes
   (that is, low-dimensional phenotype spaces), frequency dependence needs
   to be strong to generate diversity. However, we show that if the
   ecological properties of an organism are determined by multiple traits
   with complex interactions, the conditions needed for frequency-dependent
   selection to generate diversity are relaxed to the point where they are
   easily satisfied in high-dimensional phenotype spaces. Mathematically,
   this phenomenon is reflected in properties of eigenvalues of quadratic
   forms. Because all living organisms have at least hundreds of
   phenotypes, this casts the potential importance of frequency dependence
   for the origin and maintenance of diversity in a new light.},

Abstract = {Graph theory is a powerful body of mathematical knowledge, based on
   simple concepts, in which structural units are depicted as nodes with
   relationships between them depicted as lines The nodes may have
   qualitative and quantitative characteristics, and the edges may have
   properties such as weights and directions Graph theory provides a
   flexible conceptual model that can clarify the relationship between
   structures and processes, including the mechanisms of configuration
   effects and compositional differences Graph concepts apply to many
   ecological and evolutionary phenomena, including interspecific
   associations, spatial structure, dispersal in landscapes, and
   relationships within metapopulations and metacommunities We review
   applications of graph theory in biology, emphasizing graphs with spatial
   contexts We show how spatial graph properties can be used for
   description and comparison as well as to test specific hypotheses We
   suggest that future applications should include explicit spatial
   elements for landscape studies of ecological, genetic and

Title = {The non-local Fisher-KPP equation: travelling waves and steady states},
Journal = {NONLINEARITY},
Year = {2009},

Number = {12},
Pages = {2813-2844},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We consider the Fisher-KPP equation with a non-local saturation effect
   defined through an interaction kernel phi(x) and investigate the
   possible differences with the standard Fisher-KPP equation. Our first
   concern is the existence of steady states. We prove that if the Fourier
   transform (phi) over cap(xi) is positive or if the length sigma of the
   non-local interaction is short enough, then the only steady states are u
   equivalent to 0 and u equivalent to 1. Next, we study existence of the
   travelling waves. We prove that this equation admits travelling wave
   solutions that connect u = 0 to an unknown positive steady state
   u(infinity)(x), for all speeds c >= c{*}. The travelling wave connects
   to the standard state u(infinity)(x) = 1 under the aforementioned
   conditions: (phi) over cap(xi) > 0 or sigma is sufficiently small.
   However, the wave is not monotonic for sigma large.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {A method for solving boundary value problems (BVPs) is introduced using
   artificial neural networks (ANNs) for irregular domain boundaries with
   mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions (BCs). The approximate ANN
   solution automatically satisfies BCs at all stages of training,
   including before training commences. This method is simpler than other
   ANN methods for solving BVPs due to its unconstrained nature and because
   automatic satisfaction of Dirichlet BCs provides a good starting
   approximate solution for significant portions of the domain. Automatic
   satisfaction of BCs is accomplished by the introduction of an innovative
   length factor. Several examples of BVP solution are presented for both
   linear and nonlinear differential equations in two and three dimensions.
   Error norms in the approximate solution on the order of 10(-4) to 10(-5)
   are reported for all example problems.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary ecologists and population biologists have recently
   considered that ecological and evolutionary changes are intimately
   linked and can occur on the same time-scale. Recent theoretical
   developments have shown how the feedback between ecological and
   evolutionary dynamics can be linked, and there are now empirical
   demonstrations showing that ecological change can lead to rapid
   evolutionary change. We also have evidence that microevolutionary change
   can leave an ecological signature. We are at a stage where the
   integration of ecology and evolution is a necessary step towards major
   advances in our understanding of the processes that shape and maintain
   biodiversity. This special feature about `eco-evolutionary dynamics'
   brings together biologists from empirical and theoretical backgrounds to
   bridge the gap between ecology and evolution and provide a series of
   contributions aimed at quantifying the interactions between these
   fundamental processes.},

Title = {A simple model of bipartite cooperation for ecological and

Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2009},

Number = {7228},
Pages = {463-466},

Abstract = {In theoretical ecology, simple stochastic models that satisfy two basic
   conditions about the distribution of niche values and feeding ranges
   have proved successful in reproducing the overall structural properties
   of real food webs, using species richness and connectance as the only
   input parameters(1-4). Recently, more detailed models have incorporated
   higher levels of constraint in order to reproduce the actual links
   observed in real food webs(5,6). Here, building on previous stochastic
   models of consumer - resource interactions between species(1-3), we
   propose a highly parsimonious model that can reproduce the overall
   bipartite structure of cooperative partner - partner interactions, as
   exemplified by plant - animal mutualistic networks(7). Our stochastic
   model of bipartite cooperation uses simple specialization and
   interaction rules, and only requires three empirical input parameters.
   We test the bipartite cooperation model on ten large pollination data
   sets that have been compiled in the literature, and find that it
   successfully replicates the degree distribution, nestedness and
   modularity of the empirical networks. These properties are regarded as
   key to understanding cooperation in mutualistic networks(8-10). We also
   apply our model to an extensive data set of two classes of company
   engaged in joint production in the garment industry. Using the same
   metrics, we find that the network of manufacturer - contractor
   interactions exhibits similar structural patterns to plant - animal
   pollination networks. This surprising correspondence between ecological
   and organizational networks suggests that the simple rules of
   cooperation that generate bipartite networks may be generic, and could
   prove relevant in many different domains, ranging from biological
   systems to human society(11-14).},

   studies are classified according to the direction of causality in
   network studies. In the literature, some studies focus on the effect of
   networks, while others on the origins and formation of networks. These
   are represented as a circular flow diagram of network research. Circular
   diagram includes three themes of analysis as: (1) origins of networks,
   (2) firm performance, (3) network structure, and shows the relationship
   between these themes as observed in network research. The aim of this
   survey is to guide researchers working on inter-firm networks about the
   theoretical and empirical results obtained up to now in the field and to
   highlight those areas which need further work.},

Number = {7223},
Pages = {792-U76},
Month = {DEC 11},
Abstract = {A central question in ecology with great importance for management,
   conservation and biological control is how changing connectivity affects
   the persistence and dynamics of interacting species. Researchers in many
   disciplines have used large systems of coupled oscillators to model the
   behaviour of a diverse array of fluctuating systems in nature(1-4). In
   the well- studied regime of weak coupling, synchronization is favoured
   by increases in coupling strength and large- scale network structures (
   for example `small worlds') that produce short cuts and clustering(5-9).
   Here we show that, by contrast, randomizing the structure of dispersal
   networks in a model of predators and prey tends to favour asynchrony and
   prolonged transient dynamics, with resulting effects on the amplitudes
   of population fluctuations. Our results focus on synchronization and
   dynamics of clusters in models, and on time-scales, more appropriate for
   ecology, namely smaller systems with strong interactions outside the
   weak- coupling regime, rather than the better- studied cases of large,
   weakly coupled systems. In these smaller systems, the dynamics of
   transients and the effects of changes in connectivity can be well
   understood using a set of methods including numerical reconstructions of
   phase dynamics, examinations of cluster formation and the consideration
   of important aspects of cyclic dynamics, such as amplitude.},

Abstract = {Darwin himself suggested the idea of generalizing the core Darwinian
   principles to cover the evolution of social entities. Also in the
   nineteenth century, influential social scientists proposed their
   extension to political society and economic institutions. Nevertheless,
   misunderstanding and misrepresentation have hindered the realization of
   the powerful potential in this longstanding idea. Some critics confuse
   generalization with analogy. Others mistakenly presume that generalizing
   Darwinism necessarily involves biological reductionism. This essay
   outlines the types of phenomena to which a generalized Darwinism
   applies, and upholds that there is no reason to exclude social or

Abstract = {River networks, seen as ecological corridors featuring connected and
   hierarchical dendritic landscapes for animals and plants, present unique
   challenges and opportunities for testing biogeographical theories and
   macroecological laws(1). Although local and basin- scale differences in
   riverine fish diversity have been analysed as functions of energy
   availability and habitat heterogeneity(2), scale- dependent
   environmental conditions(3) and river discharge(4,5), a model that
   predicts a comprehensive set of system-wide diversity patterns has been
   hard to find. Here we show that fish diversity patterns throughout the
   Mississippi - Missouri River System are well described by a neutral
   metacommunity model coupled with an appropriate habitat capacity
   distribution and dispersal kernel. River network structure acts as an
   effective template for characterizing spatial attributes of fish
   biodiversity. We show that estimates of average dispersal behaviour and
   habitat capacities, objectively calculated from average runoff
   production, yield reliable predictions of large- scale spatial
   biodiversity patterns in riverine systems. The success of the neutral
   theory in two- dimensional forest ecosystems(6-8) and here in dendritic
   riverine ecosystems suggests the possible application of neutral
   metacommunity models in a diverse suite of ecosystems. This framework
   offers direct linkage from large- scale forcing, such as global climate
   change, to biodiversity patterns.},

Number = {8},
Pages = {1885-1896},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Q(ST) is a commonly used metric of the degree of genetic differentiation
   among populations displayed by quantitative traits. Typically, Q(ST) is
   compared to F-ST measured on putatively neutral loci; if Q(ST) = F-ST,
   this is taken as evidence of spatially heterogeneous and diversifying
   selection. This paper reviews the uses, assumptions and statistics of
   Q(ST) and F-ST comparisons. Unfortunately, Q(ST)/F-ST comparisons are
   statistically challenging. For a single trait, Q(ST) must be compared
   not to the mean F-ST but to the distribution of F-ST values. The sources
   of biases and sampling error for Q(ST) are reviewed, and a new method
   for comparing Q(ST) and F-ST is suggested. Simulation results suggest
   that the distribution of neutral F-ST and Q(ST) values are little
   affected by various deviations from the island model. Consequently, the
   distributions of Q(ST) and F-ST are well approximated by the
   Lewontin-Krakauer prediction, even with realistic deviations from the
   island-model assumptions.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Biologists seek an understanding of the processes underlying spatial
   biodiversity patterns. Neutral theory links those patterns to dispersal,
   speciation and community drift. Here, we advance the spatially explicit
   neutral model by representing the metacommunity as a network of smaller
   communities. Analytic theory is presented for a set of equilibrium
   diversity patterns in networks of communities, facilitating the
   exploration of parameter space not accessible by simulation. We use this
   theory to evaluate how the basic properties of a metacommunity -
   connectivity, size, and speciation rate - determine overall
   metacommunity gamma-diversity, and how that is partitioned into alpha-
   and beta-components. We find spatial structure can increase
   gamma-diversity relative to a well-mixed model, even when theta is held
   constant. The magnitude of deviations from the well-mixed model and the
   partitioning into alpha- and beta-diversity is related to the ratio of
   migration and speciation rates. gamma-diversity scales linearly with
   metacommunity size even as alpha- and beta-diversity scale nonlinearly
   with size.},

Abstract = {Maintaining connectivity for broad-scale ecological processes like
   dispersal and gene flow is essential for conserving endangered species
   in fragmented landscapes. However, determining which habitats should be
   set aside to promote connectivity has been difficult because existing
   models cannot incorporate effects of multiple pathways linking
   populations. Here, we test an ecological connectivity model that
   overcomes this obstacle by borrowing from electrical circuit theory. The
   model vastly improves gene flow predictions because it simultaneously
   integrates all possible pathways connecting populations. When applied to
   data from threatened mammal and tree species, the model consistently
   outperformed conventional gene flow models, revealing that barriers were
   less important in structuring populations than previously thought.
   Circuit theory now provides the best-justified method to bridge
   landscape and genetic data, and holds much promise in ecology,
   evolution, and conservation planning.},

Title = {Habitat and climate heterogeneity maintain beta-diversity of birds among

Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {650-656},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Aim Habitat and climate heterogeneity may affect patterns of species
   diversity from the relatively local scale of communities to the broad
   biogeographical scale of continents. However, the effects of
   heterogeneity on species diversity have not been studied as widely at
   intermediate scales although differences among landscapes in local
   climate and habitat should maintain beta-diversity.
   Location Bailey ecoregions in the USA.
   Methods Using a geographically extensive dataset on bird distribution
   and abundance in 35 ecoregions, we tested for the effects of habitat and
   climate heterogeneity on beta-diversity at two discrete spatial scales:
   among sample points within landscapes, and among landscapes within
   ecoregions.
   Results Landscape-level beta-diversity typically accounted for 50\% or
   more of gamma-diversity and was significantly and positively related to
   habitat heterogeneity (elevational range within an ecoregion) and
   climate heterogeneity (variation in potential evapotranspiration).
   Contrary to predictions, point-level beta-diversity was negatively
   related to habitat and climate heterogeneity, perhaps because
   heterogeneity constrains alpha-diversity at the landscape level. The
   geographical spatial separation of landscapes within an ecoregion did
   not significantly affect beta-diversity at either scale.
   Main conclusions Our results suggest that habitat selection and
   adaptation to local climate may be the primary processes structuring
   bird diversity among landscapes within ecoregions, and that dispersal
   limitation has a lesser role in influencing beta-diversity among
   landscapes.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present a springboard perspective to describe the
   internationalization of emerging market multinational corporations ( EM
   MNEs). EM MNEs use international expansion as a springboard to acquire
   strategic resources and reduce their institutional and market
   constraints at home. In so doing, they overcome their latecomer
   disadvantage in the global stage via a series of aggressive, risk-taking
   measures by aggressively acquiring or buying critical assets from mature
   MNEs to compensate for their competitive weaknesses. We discuss unique
   traits that characterize the international expansion of EM MNEs, and the
   unique motivations that steer them toward internationalization. We
   further delineate peculiar strategies and activities undertaken by these
   firms in pursuit of international expansion, as well as internal and
   external forces that might compel or facilitate their propulsion into
   the global scene. We finally explain the risks and remedies associated
   with this international `springboarding' strategy and highlight major

Title = {The multifarious effects of dispersal and gene flow on contemporary
   adaptation},
Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {434-443},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. Dispersal and gene flow can have a variety of interacting effects on
   evolution. These effects can either promote or constrain adaptive
   divergence through either genetic or demographic routes. The relative
   importance of these effects is unknown because few attempts have been
   made to conceptually integrate and test them.
   2. We draw a broad distinction between situations with vs. without
   strong coevolutionary dynamics. This distinction is important because
   the adaptive peak for a given population is more mobile in the former
   than in the latter. This difference makes ongoing evolutionary potential
   more important in the presence of strong coevolutionary dynamics than in
   their absence.
   3. We advance a conceptual integration of the various effects of gene
   flow and dispersal on adaptive divergence. In line with other authors,
   but not necessarily for the same reasons, we suggest that an
   intermediate level of gene flow will allow the greatest adaptive
   divergence.
   4. When dispersal is quite low, we predict that an increase will have
   positive effects on adaptive divergence, owing to genetic/demographic
   rescue and `reinforcement.' The rescue effect may be more important in
   small populations and in homogeneous environments. The reinforcement
   effect may be more common in large populations and in heterogeneous
   environments.
   5. Once a certain level of dispersal is reached, we predict that a
   further increase may have negative effects on adaptive divergence. These
   effects may arise if carrying capacity is exceeded or maladaptive genes
   are introduced.
   Many additional effects remain to be integrated into this framework, and
   doing so may yield novel insights into the factors influencing evolution
   on ecological time-scales.},

Abstract = {A major goal of ecology is to determine the causes of the latitudinal
   gradient in global distribution of species richness. Current evidence
   points to either energy availability or habitat heterogeneity as the
   most likely environmental drivers in terrestrial systems, but their
   relative importance is controversial in the absence of analyses of
   global (rather than continental or regional) extent. Here we use data on
   the global distribution of extant continental and continental island
   bird species to test the explanatory power of energy availability and
   habitat heterogeneity while simultaneously addressing issues of spatial
   resolution, spatial autocorrelation, geometric constraints upon species'
   range dynamics, and the impact of human populations and historical
   glacial ice-cover. At the finest resolution (1 degrees), topographical
   variability and temperature are identified as the most important global
   predictors of avian species richness in multipredictor models.
   Topographical variability is most important in single-predictor models,
   followed by productive energy. Adjusting for null expectations based on
   geometric constraints on species richness improves overall model fit but
   has negligible impact on tests of environmental predictors. Conclusions
   concerning the relative importance of environmental predictors of
   species richness cannot be extrapolated from one biogeographic realm to
   others or the globe. Rather a global perspective confirms the primary
   importance of mountain ranges in high-energy areas.},

Abstract = {Plants, with an estimated 300,000 species, provide crucial primary
   production and ecosystem structure. To date, our quantitative
   understanding of diversity gradients of megadiverse clades such as
   plants has been hampered by the paucity of distribution data. Here, we
   investigate the global-scale species-richness pattern of vascular plants
   and examine its environmental and potential historical determinants.
   Across 1,032 geographic regions worldwide, potential evapotranspiration,
   the number of wet days per year, and measurements of topographical and
   habitat heterogeneity emerge as core predictors of species richness.
   After accounting for environmental effects, the residual differences
   across the major floristic kingdoms are minor, with the exception of the
   uniquely diverse Cape Region, highlighting the important role of
   historical contingencies. Notably, the South African Cape region
   contains more than twice as many species as expected by the global
   environmental model, confirming its uniquely evolved flora. A combined
   multipreclictor model explains approximate to 70\% of the global
   variation in species richness and fully accounts for the enigmatic
   latitudinal gradient in species richness. The models illustrate the
   geographic interplay of different environmental predictors of species
   richness. Our findings highlight that different hypotheses about the
   causes of diversity gradients are not mutually exclusive, but likely act
   synergistically with water-energy dynamics playing a dominant role. The
   presented geostatistical approach is likely to prove instrumental for
   identifying richness patterns of the many other taxa without
   single-species distribution data that still escape our understanding.},

Abstract = {Dynamical reaction - diffusion processes and metapopulation models are
   standard modelling approaches for a wide array of phenomena in which
   local quantities - such as density, potentials and particles - diffuse
   and interact according to the physical laws. Here, we study the
   behaviour of the basic reaction - diffusion process ( given by the
   reaction steps B -> A and B+ A -> 2B) defined on networks with
   heterogeneous topology and no limit on the nodes' occupation number. We
   investigate the effect of network topology on the basic properties of
   the system's phase diagram and find that the network heterogeneity
   sustains the reaction activity even in the limit of a vanishing density
   of particles, eventually suppressing the critical point in
   density-driven phase transitions, whereas phase transition and critical
   points independent of the particle density are not altered by
   topological fluctuations. This work lays out a theoretical and
   computational microscopic framework for the study of a wide range of
   realistic metapopulation and agent-based models that include the complex
   features of real-world networks.},

Abstract = {The nonlocal Fisher equation has been proposed as a simple model
   exhibiting Turing instability and the interpretation refers to adaptive
   evolution. By analogy with other formalisms used in adaptive dynamics,
   it is expected that concentration phenomena (like convergence to a sum
   of Dirac masses) will happen in the limit of small mutations. In the
   present work we study this asymptotics by using a change of variables
   that leads to a constrained Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We prove the
   convergence analytically and illustrate it numerically. We also
   illustrate numerically how the constraint is related to the
   concentration points. We investigate numerically some features of these
   concentration points such as their weights and their numbers. We show
   analytically how the constrained Hamilton-Jacobi gives the so-called
   canonical equation relating their motion with the selection gradient. We
   illustrate this point numerically.},

Title = {Adaptive vs. neutral genetic diversity: implications for landscape
   genetics},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {21},
Number = {6},
Pages = {797-807},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Genetic diversity is important for the maintenance of the viability and
   the evolutionary or adaptive potential of populations and species.
   However, there are two principal types of genetic diversity: adaptive
   and neutral - a fact widely neglected by non-specialists. We introduce
   these two types of genetic diversity and critically point to their
   potential uses and misuses in population or landscape genetic studies.
   First, most molecular-genetic laboratory techniques analyse neutral
   genetic variation. This means that the gene variants detected do not
   have any direct effect on fitness. This type of genetic variation is
   thus selectively neutral and tells us nothing about the adaptive or
   evolutionary potential of a population or a species. Nevertheless,
   neutral genetic markers have great potential for investigating processes
   such as gene flow, migration or dispersal. Hence, they allow us to
   empirically test the functional relevance of spatial indices such as
   connectivity used in landscape ecology. Second, adaptive genetic
   variation, i.e. genetic variation under natural selection, is analysed
   in quantitative genetic experiments under controlled and uniform
   environmental conditions. Unfortunately, the genetic variation (i.e.
   heritability) and population differentiation at quantitative, adaptive
   traits is not directly linked with neutral genetic diversity or
   differentiation. Thus, neutral genetic data cannot serve as a surrogate
   of adaptive genetic data. In summary, neutral genetic diversity is well
   suited for the study of processes within landscapes such as gene flow,
   while the evolutionary or adaptive potential of populations or species
   has to be assessed in quantitative genetic experiments. Landscape
   ecologists have to mind these differences between neutral and adaptive
   genetic variation when interpreting the results of landscape genetic
   studies.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {297-321},

Abstract = {A distinctive signature of living systems is Darwinian evolution, that
   is, a propensity to generate its well as self-select individual
   diversity. To capture this essential feature of life while describing
   the dynamics Of Populations, mathematical models must be rooted in the
   microscopic, stochastic description of discrete individuals
   characterized by one or several adaptive traits and interacting with
   each other. The simplest models assume asexual reproduction and haploid
   genetics: an offspring usually inherits the trait values of her
   progenitor, except when a Mutation causes the offspring to take it
   mutation step to new trait values; selection follows from ecological
   interactions among individuals. Here we present it rigorous construction
   of the microscopic population process that captures the probabilistic
   dynamics over continuous time of birth, mutation, and death, as
   influenced by the trait values of each individual, and interactions
   between individuals. A by-product of this formal construction is a
   general algorithm for efficient numerical simulation of the
   individual-level model. Once the microscopic process is in place, we
   derive different macroscopic models of adaptive evolution. These models
   differ in the renormalization they assume, i.e. in the limits taken, in
   specific orders, on population size, initiation rate, mutation step,
   while rescaling time accordingly. The macroscopic models also differ in
   their mathematical nature: deterministic, in the form of ordinary,
   integro-, or partial differential equations, or probabilistic, like
   stochastic partial differential equations or superprocesses. These
   models include extensions of Kimura's equation (and of its approximation
   for small mutation effects) to frequency- and density-dependent
   selection. A novel class of macroscopic models obtains when assuming
   that individual birth and death occur on a short timescale compared with
   the timescale of typical Population growth. On a timescale of very rare
   mutations, we establish rigorously the models of ``trait substitution
   sequences{''} and their approximation known as the ``canonical equation
   of adaptive dynamics{''}. We extend these models to account for mutation
   bias and random drift between multiple evolutionary attractors. The
   renormalization approach used in this Study also opens promising avenues
   to Study and predict patterns of life-history allometries, thereby
   bridging individual physiology, genetic variation, and ecological
   interactions in it common evolutionary framework. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Ecologists have long been puzzled by the fact that there are so many
   similar species in nature. Here we show that self-organized clusters of
   look-a-likes may emerge spontaneously from coevolution of competitors.
   The explanation is that there are two alternative ways to survive
   together: being sufficiently different or being sufficiently similar.
   Using a model based on classical competition theory, we demonstrate a
   tendency for evolutionary emergence of regularly spaced lumps of similar
   species along a niche axis. Indeed, such lumpy patterns are commonly
   observed in size distributions of organisms ranging from algae,
   zooplankton, and beetles to birds and mammals, and could not be well
   explained by earlier theory. Our results suggest that these patterns may
   represent self-constructed niches emerging from competitive
   interactions. A corollary of our findings is that, whereas in
   species-poor communities sympatric speciation and invasion of open
   niches is possible, species-saturated communities may be characterized
   by convergent evolution and invasion by look-a-likes.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze explicit exponential Runge-Kutta
   methods for the time integration of semilinear parabolic problems. The
   analysis is performed in an abstract Banach space framework of sectorial
   operators and locally Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities. We commence
   by giving a new and short derivation of the classical (nonstiff) order
   conditions for exponential Runge-Kutta methods, but the main interest of
   our paper lies in the stiff case. By expanding the errors of the
   numerical method in terms of the solution, we derive new order
   conditions that form the basis of our error bounds for parabolic
   problems. We show convergence for methods up to order four, and we
   analyze methods that were recently presented in the literature. These
   methods have classical order four, but they do not satisfy some of the
   new conditions. Therefore, an order reduction is expected. We present
   numerical experiments which show that this order reduction in fact
   arises in practical examples. Based on our new conditions, we finally
   construct methods that do not suffer from order reduction.},

Abstract = {This paper pursues a research agenda inspired by Richard Nelson and
   Sidney Winter's Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change (1982). This
   seminal work applied the Darwinian concepts of variation, replication
   and selection to the evolution of firms. It proposed a level of
   evolution, replication and selection at a level higher than individuals
   or genes, involving the replication and selection of routines and
   institutions. Significantly, the applicability or otherwise of these
   Darwinian concepts depends on precise definitions of terms such as
   replication and selection. The present essay builds on previous work
   where the concepts of replication (Godfrey-Smith, 2000; Aunger, 2002;
   Hodgson, 2003b) and selection (Price, 1995; Frank, 1998; Knudsen, 2002b,
   2003) have been refined. We deploy the key concepts of `replicator' and
   `interactor' from the modern philosophy of biology (Hull, 1981, 1988).
   It is shown that while habits and routines can be regarded as
   replicators, there is a case for regarding firms and similarly cohesive
   organizations as interactors. We explore some of the implications of
   this result and provide an important component in the construction of a
   multiple-level evolutionary theory, involving replicating units at
   several socio-economic levels.},

Abstract = {The metacommunity concept is an important way to think about linkages
   between different spatial scales in ecology. Here we review current
   understanding about this concept. We first investigate issues related to
   its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by
   dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify
   four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the
   species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that
   each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in
   metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and
   we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then
   use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying
   existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both
   theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand
   increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple
   scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity
   can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that
   would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local
   communities alone.},

Abstract = {Most studies of plant-animal mutualisms involve a small number of
   species. There is almost no information on the structural organization
   of species-rich mutualistic networks despite its potential importance
   for the maintenance of diversity. Here we analyze 52 mutualistic
   networks and show that they are highly nested; that is, the more
   specialist species interact only with proper subsets of those species
   interacting with the more generalists. This assembly pattern generates
   highly asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community cohesively
   around a central core of interactions. Thus, mutualistic networks are
   neither randomly assembled nor organized in compartments arising from
   tight, parallel specialization. Furthermore, nestedness increases with
   the complexity (number of interactions) of the network: for a given
   number of species, communities with more interactions are significantly
   more nested. Our results indicate a nonrandom pattern of community
   organization that may be relevant for our understanding of the
   organization and persistence of biodiversity.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Understanding the processes and patterns of gene flow and local
   adaptation requires a detailed knowledge of how landscape
   characteristics structure populations. This understanding is crucial,
   not only for improving ecological knowledge, but also for managing
   properly the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered populations.
   For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have investigated how
   physiognomy and other landscape features have influenced genetic
   variation within and between populations. They have relied on sampling
   populations that have been identified beforehand because most population
   genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a new
   approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without
   requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This
   approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding
   of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic
   variation at both the population and individual levels, and has
   implications for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. It differs
   from other genetic approaches, such as phylogeography, in that it tends
   to focus on processes at finer spatial and temporal scales. Here, we
   discuss, from a population genetic perspective, the current tools
   available for conducting studies of landscape genetics.},

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2, 2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We study assortative mixing in networks, the tendency for vertices in
   networks to be connected to other vertices that are like (or unlike)
   them in some way. We consider mixing according to discrete
   characteristics such as language or race in social networks and scalar
   characteristics such as age. As a special example of the latter we
   consider mixing according to vertex degree, i.e., according to the
   number of connections vertices have to other vertices: do gregarious
   people tend to associate with other gregarious people? We propose a
   number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various
   mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks,
   showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many
   networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed
   networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and
   numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques. We use
   these models to probe the properties of networks as their level of
   assortativity is varied. In the particular case of mixing by degree, we
   find strong variation with assortativity in the connectivity of the

Abstract = {Traditional discussions of speciation are based on geographical patterns
   of species ranges(1,2). In allopatric speciation, long-term geographical
   isolation generates reproductively isolated and spatially segregated
   descendant species(1,3). In the absence of geographical barriers,
   diversification is hindered by gene flow(1,3,4). Yet a growing body of
   phylogenetic and experimental data suggests that closely related species
   often occur in sympatry or have adjacent ranges in regions over which
   environmental changes are gradual and do not prevent gene flow(5-14).
   Theory has identified a variety of evolutionary processes that can
   result in speciation under sympatric conditions(15-25), with some recent
   advances concentrating on the phenomenon of evolutionary
   branching(18,23-25). Here we establish a link between geographical
   patterns and ecological processes of speciation by studying evolutionary
   branching in spatially structured populations. We show that along an
   environmental gradient, evolutionary branching can occur much more
   easily than in non-spatial models. This facilitation is most pronounced
   for gradients of intermediate slope. Moreover, spatial evolutionary
   branching readily generates patterns of spatial segregation and abutment
   between the emerging species. Our results highlight the importance of
   local processes of adaptive divergence for geographical patterns of
   speciation, and caution against pitfalls of inferring past speciation
   processes from present biogeographical patterns.},

Abstract = {Brownian motion and normal distribution have been widely used in the
   Black-Scholes option-pricing framework to model the return of assets.
   However, two puzzles emerge from many empirical investigations: the
   leptokurtic feature that the return distribution of assets may have a
   higher peak and two (asymmetric) heavier tails than those of the normal
   distribution, and an empirical phenomenon called ``volatility smile{''}
   in option markets. To incorporate both of them and to strike a balance
   between reality and tractability, this paper proposes, for the purpose
   of option pricing, a double exponential jump-diffusion model. In
   particular, the model is simple enough to produce analytical solutions
   for a variety of option-pricing problems, including call and put
   options, interest rate derivatives, and path-dependent options.
   Equilibrium analysis and a psychological interpretation of the model are
   also presented.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {259-281},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Several social scientists, including `evolutionary economists', have
   expressed scepticism of `biological analogies' and rejected the
   application of `Darwinism' to socio-economic evolution. Among this
   group, some have argued that self-organisation is an alternative to
   biological analogies or Darwinism. Others have seen `artificial
   selection' as an alternative to natural selection in the socio-economic
   sphere. Another objection is that Darwinism excludes human
   intentionality. It is shown that all these objections to `biological
   analogies' and `Darwinism' are ungrounded. Furthermore, Darwinism
   includes a broad theoretical framework for the analysis of the evolution
   of all open, complex systems, including socio-economic systems. Finally
   and crucially, Darwinism also involves a basic philosophical commitment
   to detailed, cumulative, causal explanations. For these reasons,
   Darwinism is fully relevant for economics and an adequate evolutionary
   economics must be Darwinian, at least in these fundamental senses.
   However, this does not undermine the need for auxiliary theories and
   explanations in the economic domain.},

Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Plants can have positive effects on each other(1). For example, the
   accumulation of nutrients, provision of shade, amelioration of
   disturbance, or protection from herbivores by some species can enhance
   the performance of neighbouring species. Thus the notion that the
   distributions and abundances of plant species are independent of other
   species may be inadequate as a theoretical underpinning for
   understanding species coexistence and diversity(2). But there have been
   no large-scale experiments designed to examine the generality of
   positive interactions in plant communities and their importance relative
   to competition. Here we show that the biomass, growth and reproduction
   of alpine plant species are higher when other plants are nearby. In an
   experiment conducted in subalpine and alpine plant communities with 115
   species in 11 different mountain ranges, we find that competition
   generally, but not exclusively, dominates interactions at lower
   elevations where conditions are less physically stressful. In contrast,
   at high elevations where abiotic stress is high the interactions among
   plants are predominantly positive. Furthermore, across all high and low
   sites positive interactions are more important at sites with low
   temperatures in the early summer, but competition prevails at warmer
   sites.},

Abstract = {The search for a common cause of species richness gradients has spawned
   more than 100 explanatory hypotheses in just the past two decades.
   Despite recent conceptual advances, further refinement of the most
   plausible models has been stifled by the difficulty of compiling
   high-resolution databases at continental scales. We used a database of
   the geographic ranges of 2,869 species of birds breeding in South
   America (nearly a third of the world's living avian species) to explore
   the influence of climate, quadrat area, ecosystem diversity, and
   topography on species richness gradients at 10 spatial scales (quadrat
   area, approximate to 12,300 to approximate to1,225,000 km(2)).
   Topography, precipitation, topography x latitude, ecosystem diversity,
   and cloud cover emerged as the most important predictors of regional
   variability of species richness in regression models incorporating 16
   independent variables, although ranking of variables depended on spatial
   scale. Direct measures of ambient energy such as mean and maximum
   temperature were of ancillary importance. Species richness values for 1
   degrees x 1 degrees latitude-longitude quadrats in the Andes (peaking at
   845 species) were approximate to 30-250\% greater than those recorded at
   equivalent latitudes in the central Amazon basin. These findings reflect
   the extraordinary abundance of species associated with humid montane
   regions at equatorial latitudes and the importance of orography in avian
   speciation. In a broader context, our data reinforce the hypothesis that
   terrestrial species richness from the equator to the poles is ultimately
   governed by a synergism between climate and coarse-scale topographic
   heterogeneity.},

   considering the mixing of any density of travelling fronts, we prove the

   particular, there are infinite-dimensional manifolds of (nonplanar)
   travelling fronts acid radial solutions. Furthermore, up to an

Title = {On the origin of species by sympatric speciation},

Abstract = {Understanding speciation is a fundamental biological problem. It is
   believed that many species originated through allopatric divergence,
   where new species arise from geographically isolated populations of the
   same ancestral species(1-3). In contrast, the possibility of sympatric
   speciation (in which new species arise without geographical isolation)
   has often been dismissed, partly because of theoretical
   difficulties(2,3). Most previous models analysing sympatric speciation
   concentrated on particular aspects of the problem while neglecting
   others(4-10). Here we present a model that integrates a novel
   combination of different features and show that sympatric speciation is
   a likely outcome of competition for resources. We use multilocus
   genetics to describe sexual reproduction in an individual-based model,
   and we consider the evolution of assortative mating (where individuals
   mate preferentially with like individuals) depending either on an
   ecological character affecting resource use or on a selectively neutral
   marker trait. In both cases, evolution of assortative mating often leads
   to reproductive isolation between ecologically diverging subpopulations.
   When assortative mating depends on a marker trait, and is therefore not
   directly linked to resource competition, speciation occurs when genetic
   drift breaks the linkage equilibrium between the marker and the
   ecological trait. Our theory conforms well with mounting empirical
   evidence for the-sympatric origin of many species(10-18).},

Abstract = {Processes governing patterns of richness of riverine fish species at the
   global level can be modelled using artificial neural network (ANN)
   procedures. These ANNs are the most recent development in computer-aided
   identification and are very different from conventional techniques(1,2).
   Here we use the potential of ANNs to deal with some of the persistent
   fuzzy and nonlinear problems that confound classical statistical methods
   for species diversity prediction. We show that riverine fish diversity
   patterns on a global scale can be successfully predicted by geographical
   patterns in local river conditions. Nonlinear relationships, fitted by
   ANN methods, adequately describe the data, with up to 93 per cent of the
   total variation in species richness being explained by our results.
   These findings highlight the dominant effect of energy availability and
   habitat heterogeneity on patterns of global fish diversity. Our results
   reinforce the species-energy theory(3) and contrast with those from a
   recent study on North American mammal species(4), but, more
   interestingly, they demonstrate the applicability of ANN methods in
   ecology.},

Volume = {150},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-23},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Gene flow from the center of a species' range can stymie adaptation at
   the periphery and prevent the range from expanding outward. We study
   this process using simple models that track both demography and the
   evolution of a quantitative trait in a population that is continuously
   distributed in space. Stabilizing selection acts on the trait and favors
   an optimum phenotype that changes linearly across the habitat. One of
   three outcomes is possible: the species will become extinct, expand to
   fill all of the available habitat, or be confined to a limited range in
   which it is sufficiently adapted to allow population growth. When the
   environment changes rapidly in space, increased migration inhibits local
   adaptation and so decreases the species' total population size. Gene
   flow can cause enough maladaptation that the peripheral half of a
   species' range acts as a demographic sink. The trait's genetic variance
   has little effect on species persistence or the size of the range when
   gene flow is sufficiently strong to keep population densities far below
   the carrying capacity throughout the range, but it can increase the
   range width and population size of an abundant species. Under some
   conditions, a small parameter change can dramatically shift the balance
   between gene flow and local adaptation, allowing a species with a
   limited range to suddenly expand to fill all the available habitat.},

Title = {Multi-mode interaction among technologies},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-84},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Technological innovation is manifested in the development of new
   products, processes and techniques such that emerging technologies often
   substitute for mon mature technologies. The interaction between
   technologies is typically referred to as competition, implying a
   confrontational interaction. The setting of technology strategy is thus
   often concerned with issues relating to the competition between emerging
   technologies and the response of mature technologies to the offense from
   emerging technologies--strategies for attack and defense. In this paper
   it is argued that the interaction between technologies should be viewed
   in a broader sense than mere competition, and it is suggested that a
   multi-mode framework provides a much richer setting for assessing the
   interaction of two or more technologies. This concept has been
   successfully applied in biological and organizational ecology, and it is
   shown that it can be equally useful when applied to the dynamics of
   technological interaction. It is proposed that the effect that one
   technology has on another's growth rate be taken as a classification
   criterion. Examples are given to illustrate that three major modes of
   interaction exist, namely pure competition, symbiosis and predator-prey.
   In addition, the notion that the interaction between technologies can in
   general shift temporally from one mode to another is motivated. It is
   suggested that, since the characteristics of the three modes differ from
   one another, it is appropriate to develop managerial strategies that
   apply specifically to each of the three modes, instead of just applying
   generic `competition' strategies. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {Although the unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages
   (UPGMA) acid neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithms are designed to produce
   single trees, they may derive more than one topology from a single
   matrix, depending on the order of data entry. This `'chaotic'' behavior
   is due to ties, the effects of which are rarely considered. Therefore we
   present examples of ties and show that multiple UPGMA and NJ trees
   cannot be neglected with molecular data based on allozyme distances or
   `'binary'' distances derived from random amplified polymorphic DNA,
   restriction fragments, DNA fingerprints, or general protein patterns. We
   also compare the performance of 15 computer packages with respect to
   ties. Five programs recognize the problem (PHYLIP, MVSP, SAS, SYN-TAX,
   and NTSYS) but deal with it in different ways. We further point out that
   if ties are not properly taken into account, they might affect bootstrap
   and jackknife confidence estimates. Finally, we observed that NTSYS,
   PHYLIP, MVSP, acid MVSP87 have different efficiencies in finding ties,
   and that some programs, including MEGA, may produce single alternative
   UPGMA topologies, probably due to their different rounding precisions or
   tie tolerances.},

Abstract = {Haldane (1937) showed that the reduction of equilibrium mean fitness in
   an infinite population due to recurrent deleterious mutations depends
   only on the mutation rate but not on the harmfulness of mutants. His
   analysis, as well as more recent ones (cf Crow 1970), ignored back
   mutation. The purpose of the present paper is to extend these results to
   arbitrary mutation patterns among alleles and to quantitative genetic
   traits. We derive first-order approximations for the equilibrium mean
   fitness (and the mutation load) and determine the order of the error
   term. For a metric trait under mutation-stabilizing-selection balance
   our result differs qualitatively from that of Crow and Kimura (1964),
   whose analysis is based on a Gaussian assumption. Our general approach
   also yields a mathematical proof that the variance under the usual
   mutation-stabilizing-selection model is, to first order, mu/s (the
   house-of-cards approximation) as mu/s tends to zero. This holds for
   arbitrary mutant distributions and does not require that the population
   mean coincide with the optimum. We show how the mutant distribution
   determines the order of the error term, and thus the accuracy of the
   house-of-cards approximation. Upper and lower bounds to the equilibrium
   variance are derived that deviate only to second order as mu/s tends to
   zero. The multilocus case is treated under the assumption of global
   linkage equilibrium.},

Volume = {75},

Pages = {2-16},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {All organisms, especially terrestrial plants and other sessile species,
   interact mainly with their neighbors, but neighborhoods can differ in
   composition because of dispersal and mortality. There is increasingly
   strong evidence that the spatial structure created by these forces
   profoundly influences the dynamics, composition, and biodiversity of
   communities.
   Nonspatial models predict that no more consumer species can coexist at
   equilibrium than there are limiting resources. In contrast, a similar
   model that includes neighborhood competition and random dispersal among
   sites predicts stable coexistence of a potentially unlimited number of
   species on a single resource. Coexistence occurs because species with
   sufficiently high dispersal rates persist in sites not occupied by
   superior competitors. Coexistence requires limiting similarity and
   two-way or three-way interspecific trade-offs among competitive ability,
   colonization ability, and longevity.
   This spatial competition hypothesis seems to explain the coexistence of
   the numerous plant species that compete for a single limiting resource
   in the grasslands of Cedar Creek Natural History Area. It provides a
   testable, alternative explanation for other high diversity communities,
   such as tropical forests. The model can be tested (1) by determining if
   coexisting species have the requisite trade-offs in colonization,
   competition, and longevity, (2) by addition of propagules to determine
   if local species abundances are limited by dispersal, and (3) by
   comparisons of the effects on biodiversity of high rates of propagule
   addition for species that differ in competitive ability.},

Abstract = {It is shown that for allele frequency data a useful measure of the
   extent of gene flow between a pair of populations is M = (1/F(ST) -
   1)/4, which is the estimated level of gene flow in an island model at
   equilibrium. For DNA sequence data, the same formula can be used if
   F(ST) is replaced by N(ST). In a population with restricted dispersal,
   analytic theory shows that there is a simple relationship between M and
   geographic distance in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium populations
   and that this relationship is approximately independent of mutation rate
   when the mutation rate is small. Simulation results show that with
   reasonable sample sizes, isolation by distance can indeed be detected
   and that, at least in some cases, non-equilibrium patterns can be
   distinguished. This approach to analyzing isolation by distance is used
   for two allozyme data sets, one from gulls and one from pocket gophers.},

Title = {NEUTRAL THEORY OF QUANTITATIVE GENETIC VARIANCE IN AN ISLAND MODEL WITH

Abstract = {Additive genetic variance maintained by mutation in a selectively
   neutral quantitative character is analyzed for an ideal population
   distributed on n islands, each with local effective size N, that
   exchange migrants at a small rate, m. In a stable population structure,
   the expected genetic variance maintained within islands is identical to
   that in a panmictic population of the same total size, regardless of the
   migration rate (m > 0). This result contrasts with Wright's classical
   conclusion, based on inbreeding coefficients, that at least one
   immigrant per island every other generation (Nm > 1/2) is necessary for
   the genetic variance within local populations to approach that under
   panmixia. The expected genetic variance maintained among islands is
   inversely proportional to m and increases with the number of islands,
   but is independent of N. Local extinction and colonization diminish the
   genetic variance maintained within islands by reducing the effective
   size of island populations through the founder effect, although the
   expected genetic variance within islands is nearly as large as that in a
   panmictic population of the same total effective size. If the founders
   of new colonies originate from more than one island, rates of local
   extinction and colonization larger than about twice the migration rate
   will substantially reduce the genetic variance maintained among islands.
   These results indicate the importance of mutation and migration in
   maintaining quantitative genetic variance within small local
   populations.},

Pages = {249-264},
Abstract = {A nonlocal reaction-diffusion equation is presented and analysed using
   matched asymptotic expansions and multiple timescales. The problem
   models a binary mixture undergoing phase separation. The particular form
   of the equation is motivated by arguments from the calculus of
   variations, with the nonlocality arising from an enforcement of
   conservation of mass. It is shown that the evolution of the solution can
   be characterized by tracking the motion of fronts separating phases. The
   propagation of the interfaces is found to be a coarsening process which
   depends in a nonlocal fashion on mean curvature. Several special
   features of the equations of motion for the fronts are studied, and the
   relation of this evolution to Cahn-Hilliard theory and nucleation is
   discussed.},
