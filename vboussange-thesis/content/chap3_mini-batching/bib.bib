abstract = {Recent progress in machine learning (ML) inspires the idea of improving (or learning) earth system models directly from the observations. Earth sciences already use data assimilation (DA), which underpins decades of progress in weather forecasting. DA and ML have many similarities: they are both inverse methods that can be united under a Bayesian (probabilistic) framework. ML could benefit from approaches used in DA, which has evolved to deal with real observations—these are uncertain, sparsely sampled, and only indirectly sensitive to the processes of interest. DA could also become more like ML and start learning improved models of the earth system, using parameter estimation, or by directly incorporating machine-learnable models. DA follows the Bayesian approach more exactly in terms of representing uncertainty, and in retaining existing physical knowledge, which helps to better constrain the learnt aspects of models. This article makes equivalences between DA and ML in the unifying framework of Bayesian networks. These help illustrate the equivalences between four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) DA and a recurrent neural network (RNN), for example. More broadly, Bayesian networks are graphical representations of the knowledge and processes embodied in earth system models, giving a framework for organising modelling components and knowledge, whether coming from physical equations or learnt from observations. Their full Bayesian solution is not computationally feasible but these networks can be solved with approximate methods already used in DA and ML, so they could provide a practical framework for the unification of the two. Development of all these approaches could address the grand challenge of making better use of observations to improve physical models of earth system processes.},

abstract = {We formulate an equivalence between machine learning and the formulation of statistical data assimilation as used widely in physical and biological sciences. The correspondence is that layer number in a feedforward artificial network setting is the analog of time in the data assimilation setting. This connection has been noted in the machine learning literature. We add a perspective that expands on how methods from statistical physics and aspects of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics play a role in how networks can be trained and designed. Within the discussion of this equivalence, we show that adding more layers (making the network deeper) is analogous to adding temporal resolution in a data assimilation framework. Extending this equivalence to recurrent networks is also discussed.},

@article{Xu2006,
abstract = {The Bayesian probability inversion and a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique were applied to a terrestrial ecosystem model to analyze uncertainties of estimated carbon (C) transfer coefficients and simulated C pool sizes. This study used six data sets of soil respiration, woody biomass, foliage biomass, litterfall, C content in the litter layers, and C content in mineral soil measured under both ambient CO2 (350 ppm) and elevated CO2 (550 ppm) plots from 1996 to 2000 at the Duke Forest Free-Air CO2 Experiment (FACE) site. A Metropolis-Hastings algorithm was employed to construct a posterior probability density function (PPDF) of C transfer coefficients on the basis of prior information of model parameters, model structure, and the six data sets. The constructed PPDFs indicated that the transfer coefficients from pools of nonwoody biomass, woody biomass, and structural litter were well constrained by the six data sets under both ambient and elevated CO2. The data sets also gave moderate information to the transfer coefficient from the slow soil C pool. However, the transfer coefficients from pools of metabolic litter, microbe, and passive soil C were poorly constrained. The poorly constrained parameters were attributable to either the lack of experimental data or the mismatch of timescales between the available data and the parameters to be estimated. Cumulative distribution functions were constructed for simulated C pool sizes on the basis of the six data sets, showing that on average the ecosystem would store 16,616 g C m-2 at elevated CO2 by the year 2010, significantly higher than 13,426 g C m-2 at ambient CO2 with 95% confidence. This study shows that the combination of a Bayesian approach and MCMC inversion technique is an effective method to synthesize information from various sources for assessment of ecosystem responses to elevated CO2.

abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

@article{Dong2021,
abstract = {Elimination of unknowns in a system of differential equations is often required when analysing (possibly nonlinear) dynamical systems models, where only a subset of variables are observable. One such analysis, identifiability, often relies on computing input-output relations via differential algebraic elimination. Determining identifiability, a natural prerequisite for meaningful parameter estimation, is often prohibitively expensive for medium to large systems due to the computationally expensive task of elimination. We propose an algorithm that computes a description of the set of differential-algebraic relations between the input and output variables of a dynamical system model. The resulting algorithm outperforms general-purpose software for differential elimination on a set of benchmark models from literature. We use the designed elimination algorithm to build a new randomized algorithm for assessing structural identifiability of a parameter in a parametric model. A parameter is said to be identifiable if its value can be uniquely determined from input-output data assuming the absence of noise and sufficiently exciting inputs. Our new algorithm allows the identification of models that could not be tackled before. Our implementation is publicly available as a Julia package at https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl.},

A twin experiment using simulated data of the same type and frequency as the BATS observations first demonstrates the adequacy of the observations to estimate the model parameters and model the ecosystem annual cycle. This experiment further shows that some of the model parameters cannot be estimated independently. This conclusion leads to a simplification of the model and a redefinition of its parameters. Based upon the success of the twin experiment to estimate all model parameters, an attempt to assimilate actual observations from BATS was undertaken. The assimilation of real data leads to the conclusion that, even though the frequency and type of observations is adequate to estimate the model parameters, the considered model is not appropriate for the annual cycle of the BATS ecosystem.},

abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods perform inference on model-specific parameters of mechanistically motivated parametric models when evaluating likelihoods is difficult. Central to the success of ABC methods, which have been used frequently in biology, is computationally inexpensive simulation of data sets from the parametric model of interest. However, when simulating data sets from a model is so computationally expensive that the posterior distribution of parameters cannot be adequately sampled by ABC, inference is not straightforward. We present "approximate approximate Bayesian computation" (AABC), a class of computationally fast inference methods that extends ABC to models in which simulating data is expensive. In AABC, we first simulate a number of data sets small enough to be computationally feasible to simulate from the parametric model. Conditional on these data sets, we use a statistical model that approximates the correct parametric model and enables efficient simulation of a large number of data sets. We show that under mild assumptions, the posterior distribution obtained by AABC converges to the posterior distribution obtained by ABC, as the number of data sets simulated from the parametric model and the sample size of the observed data set increase. We demonstrate the performance of AABC on a population-genetic model of natural selection, as well as on a model of the admixture history of hybrid populations. This latter example illustrates how, in population genetics, AABC is of particular utility in scenarios that rely on conceptually straightforward but potentially slow forward-in-time simulations.},

How this universe of theoretical possibilities translates into the real world is, however, poorly understood. In this paper we indirectly parameterize a theoretical model of savanna dynamics with the aim of gaining insights as to how the grass-tree balance changes across a broad biogeographical gradient. We use data on the abundance of trees in African savannas and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate the model parameters. The analysis shows that grasses and trees can coexist over a broad range of rainfall regimes. Further, our results indicate that savannas may be regulated by either asymptotically stable dynamics (in the absence of fire) or by stable limit cycles (in the presence of fire). Rainfall does not influence which, of these two classes of dynamics occurs. We conclude that, even though fire might not be necessary for grass-tree coexistence, it nonetheless is an important modifier of grass : tree ratios. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

PISCES-v2 (Pelagic Interactions Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies volume 2) is a biogeochemical model which simulates the lower trophic levels of marine ecosystems (phytoplankton, microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and of the main nutrients (P, N, Fe, and Si). The model is intended to be used for both regional and global configurations at high or low spatial resolutions as well as for short-term (seasonal, interannual) and long-term (climate change, paleoceanography) analyses. There are 24 prognostic variables (tracers) including two phytoplankton compartments (diatoms and nanophytoplankton), two zooplankton size classes (microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and a description of the carbonate chemistry. Formulations in PISCES-v2 are based on a mixed Monod–quota formalism. On the one hand, stoichiometry of C / N / P is fixed and growth rate of phytoplankton is limited by the external availability in N, P and Si. On the other hand, the iron and silicon quotas are variable and the growth rate of phytoplankton is limited by the internal availability in Fe. Various parameterizations can be activated in PISCES-v2, setting, for instance, the complexity of iron chemistry or the description of particulate organic materials. So far, PISCES-v2 has been coupled to the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) and Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) systems. A full description of PISCES-v2 and of its optional functionalities is provided here. The results of a quasi-steady-state simulation are presented and evaluated against diverse observational and satellite-derived data. Finally, some of the new functionalities of PISCES-v2 are tested in a series of sensitivity experiments.},

abstract = {Mathematical models of complex biological systems, such as metabolic or cell-signalling pathways, usually consist of sets of nonlinear ordinary differential equations which depend on several non-measurable parameters that can be hopefully estimated by fitting the model to experimental data. However, the success of this fitting is largely conditioned by the quantity and quality of data. Optimal experimental design (OED) aims to design the scheme of actuations and measurements which will result in data sets with the maximum amount and/or quality of information for the subsequent model calibration. New methods and computational procedures for OED in the context of biological systems are presented. The OED problem is formulated as a general dynamic optimisation problem where the time-dependent stimuli profiles, the location of sampling times, the duration of the experiments and the initial conditions are regarded as design variables. Its solution is approached using the control vector parameterisation method. Since the resultant nonlinear optimisation problem is in most of the cases non-convex, the use of a robust global nonlinear programming solver is proposed. For the sake of comparing among different experimental schemes, a Monte-Carlo-based identifiability analysis is then suggested. The applicability and advantages of the proposed techniques are illustrated by considering an example related to a cell-signalling pathway. {\textcopyright} The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2008.},

The innovation circumvents a disadvantage of standard model selection which typically limits the number of candidate models considered due to the intractability of computing information criteria. Using a recently developed sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm, the sub-selection of candidate models near the Pareto frontier allows feasible computation of Akaike information criteria (AIC) or Bayes information criteria scores for the remaining candidate models. The information criteria hierarchically ranks the most informative models, enabling the automatic and principled selection of the model with the strongest support in relation to the time-series data. Specifically, we show that AIC scores place each candidate model in the strong support, weak support or no support category. The method correctly recovers several canonical dynamical systems, including a susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered disease model, Burgers' equation and the Lorenz equations, identifying the correct dynamical system as the only candidate model with strong support.},

abstract = {Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widely used in ecology to describe the dynamical behavior of systems of interacting populations. However, systems of ODEs rarely provide quantitative solutions that are close to real field observations or experimental data because natural systems are subject to environmental and demographic noise and ecologists are often uncertain about the correct parameterization. In this article we introduce "parameter cascades" as an improved method to estimate ODE parameters such that the corresponding ODE solutions fit the real data well. This method is based on the modified penalized smoothing with the penalty defined by ODEs and a generalization of profiled estimation, which leads to fast estimation and good precision for ODE parameters from noisy data. This method is applied to a set of ODEs originally developed to describe an experimental predator-prey system that undergoes oscillatory dynamics. The new parameterization considerably improves the fit of the ODE model to the experimental data sets. At the same time, our method reveals that important structural assumptions that underlie the original ODE model are essentially correct. The mathematical formulations of the two nonlinear interaction terms (functional responses) that link the ODEs in the predator-prey model are validated by estimating the functional responses nonparametrically from the real data. We suggest two major applications of "parameter cascades" to ecological modeling: It can be used to estimate parameters when original data are noisy, missing, or when no reliable priori estimates are available; it can help to validate the structural soundness of the mathematical modeling approach. {\textcopyright} 2008, The International Biometric Society.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) expands traditional data analysis and presents a range of opportunities in ecosystem service (ES) research, offering rapid processing of ‘big data' and enabling significant advances in data description and predictive modelling. Descriptive ML techniques group data with little or no prior domain specific assumptions; they can generate hypotheses and automatically sort data prior to other analyses. Predictive ML techniques allow for the predictive modelling of highly non-linear systems where casual mechanisms are poorly understood, as is often the case for ES. We conducted a review to explore how ML is used in ES research and to identify and quantify trends in the different ML approaches that are used. We reviewed 308 peer-reviewed publications and identified that ES studies implemented machine learning techniques in data description (64%; n = 308) and predictive modelling (44%), with some papers containing both categories. Classification and Regression Trees were the most popular techniques (60%), but unsupervised learning techniques were also used for descriptive tasks such as clustering to group or split data without prior assumptions (19%). Whilst there are examples of ES publications that apply ML with rigour, many studies do not have robust or repeatable methods. Some studies fail to report model settings (43%) or software used (28%), and many studies do not report carrying out any form of model hyperparameter tuning (67%) or test model generalisability (59%). Whilst studies use ML to analyse very large and complex datasets, ES research is generally not taking full advantage of the capacity of ML to model big data (1138 medium number of data points; 13 median quantity of variables). There is great further opportunity to utilise ML in ES research, to make better use of big data and to develop detailed modelling of spatial-temporal dynamics that meet stakeholder demands.},

abstract = {Ecosystem dynamics are often complex, nonlinear, and characterized by critical thresholds or phase shifts. To implement sustainable management plans, resource managers need to accurately forecast species abundance. Moreover, an ecosystem-based approach to management requires forecasting the dynamics of all relevant species and the ability to anticipate indirect effects of management decisions. It is therefore crucial to determine which forecasting methods are most robust to observational and structural uncertainty. Here we describe a nonparametric method for multispecies forecasting and evaluate its performance relative to a suite of parametric models. We found that, in the presence of noise, it is often possible to obtain more accurate forecasts from the nonparametric method than from the model that was used to generate the data. The inclusion of data from additional species yielded a large improvement for the nonparametric model, a smaller improvement for the control model, and only a slight improvement for the alternative parametric models. These results suggest that flexible nonparametric modeling should be considered for ecosystem management.},

abstract = {Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

@article{DeLong2014,
abstract = {Body size is of fundamental importance to the structure and function of natural systems, yet the factors selecting for certain body sizes are still not well understood. Resource supply levels clearly play a role in setting size, but in current theory, optimality functions for body size are not tied to the population dynamics that govern resource supply, minimizing our ability to understand how body size evolves in response to the ecological context. We integrated the supply-demand (SD) model of body size evolution with a model of predator-prey dynamics to create a dynamic SD model that describes predator body size variation through time. We tested the model with experimental data on body size and abundance dynamics in the Didinium-Paramecium predator-prey system. We used a new differential equation fitting approach along with independently estimated parameters to determine whether the model could simultaneously capture both abundance and body size dynamics. The dynamics were well described by the model, supporting the notion that body size changes to match bodily demand for resources with the available supply of resources. Surprisingly, despite the 10-fold variation in Didinium body size, we found that static model parameters were sufficient to describe the data, suggesting a lack of eco-evolutionary dynamics. A pressing need in ecology is to be able to predict changes in body size under novel scenarios, especially climate warming. The dynamic SD model does this by linking body size to the ecological context in an eco-evolutionary framework. Our approach expands our ability to understand rapid linked changes in traits and abundance. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors. Functional Ecology {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {We commonly refer to state estimation theory in geosciences as data assimilation (DA). This term encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and dynamical information (such as a dynamical evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. DA is standard practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean, and environment modeling; in all circumstances where one intends to estimate the state of a large dynamical system based on limited information. While the complexity of DA, and of the methods thereof, stands on its interdisciplinary nature across statistics, dynamical systems, and numerical optimization, when applied to geosciences, an additional difficulty arises by the continually increasing sophistication of the environmental models. Thus, in spite of DA being nowadays ubiquitous in geosciences, it has so far remained a topic mostly reserved to experts. We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a background in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the rapid development of DA and its growing domains of application in environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and methodological complexities.

abstract = {Fueled by breakthrough technology developments, the biological, biomedical, and behavioral sciences are now collecting more data than ever before. There is a critical need for time- and cost-efficient strategies to analyze and interpret these data to advance human health. The recent rise of machine learning as a powerful technique to integrate multimodality, multifidelity data, and reveal correlations between intertwined phenomena presents a special opportunity in this regard. However, machine learning alone ignores the fundamental laws of physics and can result in ill-posed problems or non-physical solutions. Multiscale modeling is a successful strategy to integrate multiscale, multiphysics data and uncover mechanisms that explain the emergence of function. However, multiscale modeling alone often fails to efficiently combine large datasets from different sources and different levels of resolution. Here we demonstrate that machine learning and multiscale modeling can naturally complement each other to create robust predictive models that integrate the underlying physics to manage ill-posed problems and explore massive design spaces. We review the current literature, highlight applications and opportunities, address open questions, and discuss potential challenges and limitations in four overarching topical areas: ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, data-driven approaches, and theory-driven approaches. Towards these goals, we leverage expertise in applied mathematics, computer science, computational biology, biophysics, biomechanics, engineering mechanics, experimentation, and medicine. Our multidisciplinary perspective suggests that integrating machine learning and multiscale modeling can provide new insights into disease mechanisms, help identify new targets and treatment strategies, and inform decision making for the benefit of human health.},

abstract = {A central challenge to many fields of science and engineering involves minimizing non-convex error functions over continuous, high dimensional spaces. Gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods are almost ubiquitously used to perform such minimizations, and it is often thought that a main source of difficulty for these local methods to find the global minimum is the proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global minimum. Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix theory, neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local minimum. Motivated by these arguments, we propose a new approach to second-order optimization, the saddle-free Newton method, that can rapidly escape high dimensional saddle points, unlike gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods. We apply this algorithm to deep or recurrent neural network training, and provide numerical evidence for its superior optimization performance.},

abstract = {It is well known that current equilibrium-based models fall short as predictive descriptions of natural ecosystems, and particularly of fisheries systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics. For example, model parameters assumed to be fixed constants may actually vary in time, models may fit well to existing data but lack out-of-sample predictive skill, and key driving variables may be misidentified due to transient (mirage) correlations that are common in nonlinear systems. With these frailties, it is somewhat surprising that static equilibrium models continue to be widely used. Here, we examine empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as an alternative to imposed model equations and that accommodates both nonequilibrium dynamics and nonlinearity. Using time series from nine stocks of sockeye salmon ( Oncorhynchus nerka ) from the Fraser River system in British Columbia, Canada, we perform, for the the first time to our knowledge, real-data comparison of contemporary fisheries models with equivalent EDM formulations that explicitly use spawning stock and environmental variables to forecast recruitment. We find that EDM models produce more accurate and precise forecasts, and unlike extensions of the classic Ricker spawner–recruit equation, they show significant improvements when environmental factors are included. Our analysis demonstrates the strategic utility of EDM for incorporating environmental influences into fisheries forecasts and, more generally, for providing insight into how environmental factors can operate in forecast models, thus paving the way for equation-free mechanistic forecasting to be applied in management contexts.},

abstract = {Gibbs random fields (GRF) are polymorphous statistical models that can be used to analyse different types of dependence, in particular for spatially correlated data. However, when those models are faced with the challenge of selecting a dependence structure from many, the use of standard model choice methods is hampered by the unavailability of the normalising constant in the Gibbs likelihood. In particular, from a Bayesian perspective, the computation of the posterior probabilities of the models under competition requires special likelihood-free simulation techniques like the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm that is intensively used in population genetics. We show in this paper how to implement an ABC algorithm geared towards model choice in the general setting of Gibbs random fields, demonstrating in particular that there exists a sufficient statistic across models. The accuracy of the approximation to the posterior probabilities can be further improved by importance sampling on the distribution of the models. The practical aspects of the method are detailed through two applications, the test of an iid Bernoulli model versus a first-order Markov chain, and the choice of a folding structure for two proteins.},

Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method.

Yet the conditions for the different outcomes of competition inferred from these models are most often interpreted in terms of resources. Here it is contended that the dynamics of resource supply and exploitation must be explicitly taken into account if these conditions are to be obtained in any accurate form. First, the distinction between perfectly substitutable, imperfectly substitutable and perfectly complementary resources is examined. This leads to an array of models intended to mirror interspecific exploitative competition for two resources for each category considered. Then, the conditions for the coexistence of the two competitors in each case are derived and presented with direct reference to the modes of resource use. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

abstract = {Abstract. The long-term and large-scale dynamics of ecosystems are in large part determined by the performances of individual plants in competition with one another for light, water, and nutrients. Woody biomass, a pool of carbon (C) larger than 50% of atmospheric CO2, exists because of height-structured competition for light. However, most of the current Earth system models that predict climate change and C cycle feedbacks lack both a mechanistic formulation for height-structured competition for light and an explicit scaling from individual plants to the globe. In this study, we incorporate height-structured competition for light, competition for water, and explicit scaling from individuals to ecosystems into the land model version 3 (LM3) currently used in the Earth system models developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). The height-structured formulation is based on the perfect plasticity approximation (PPA), which has been shown to accurately scale from individual-level plant competition for light, water, and nutrients to the dynamics of whole communities. Because of the tractability of the PPA, the coupled LM3-PPA model is able to include a large number of phenomena across a range of spatial and temporal scales and still retain computational tractability, as well as close linkages to mathematically tractable forms of the model. We test a range of predictions against data from temperate broadleaved forests in the northern USA. The results show the model predictions agree with diurnal and annual C fluxes, growth rates of individual trees in the canopy and understory, tree size distributions, and species-level population dynamics during succession. We also show how the competitively optimal allocation strategy – the strategy that can competitively exclude all others – shifts as a function of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. This strategy is referred to as an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) in the ecological literature and is typically not the same as a productivity- or growth-maximizing strategy. Model simulations predict that C sinks caused by CO2 fertilization in forests limited by light and water will be down-regulated if allocation tracks changes in the competitive optimum. The implementation of the model in this paper is for temperate broadleaved forest trees, but the formulation of the model is general. It can be expanded to include other growth forms and physiologies simply by altering parameter values.},

abstract = {Forecasting the evolution of complex systems is noted as one of the 10 grand challenges of modern science. Time series data from complex systems capture the dynamic behaviors and causalities of the underlying processes and provide a tractable means to predict and monitor system state evolution. However, the nonlinear and non-stationary dynamics of the underlying processes pose a major challenge for accurate forecasting. For most real-world systems, the vector field of state dynamics is a nonlinear function of the state variables; i.e., the relationship connecting intrinsic state variables with their autoregressive terms and exogenous variables is nonlinear. Time series emerging from such complex systems exhibit aperiodic (chaotic) patterns even under steady state. Also, since real-world systems often evolve under transient conditions, the signals obtained therefrom tend to exhibit myriad forms of non-stationarity. Nonetheless, methods reported in the literature focus mostly on forecasting linear and stationary processes. This article presents a review of these advancements in nonlinear and non-stationary time series forecasting models and a comparison of their performances in certain real-world manufacturing and health informatics applications. Conventional approaches do not adequately capture the system evolution (from the standpoint of forecasting accuracy, computational effort, and sensitivity to quantity and quality of a priori information) in these applications.},

abstract = {We develop an efficient data assimilation system that aims at quantifying the uncertainties of various biogeochemical states and parameters. We explore the use of four different ensemble estimation techniques for tuning poorly constrained ecosystem parameters using a one-dimensional configuration of the Ocean Biogeochemical General Circulation Model. The schemes are all EnKF-based operating sequentially in time but have different correction equations. The 1D model is used to simulate the biogeochemical cycle at three different stations in mid and high latitudes. We assimilate monthly climatological profiles of nitrate, silicate, phosphate and oxygen in addition to seasonal surface pCO2 data, between 2006 and 2010. We use the data to optimize eleven ecosystem parameters in addition to all state variables of the model, describing the dynamical processes of the water column. Our assimilation results suggest the following: (1) Among all tested schemes, the one-step-ahead smoothing-based ensemble Kalman filter (OSA-EnKF) is robust and the most accurate, providing consistent and reliable state-parameter ensemble realizations. (2) Given the large uncertainties associated with the ecosystem parameters, estimating only the state variables is generally inconclusive and biased. (3) The OSA-EnKF successfully recovers the observed seasonal variability of the ecosystem dynamics at all stations and helps optimizing the parameters, eventually reducing the prediction errors of the nutrients' concentrations. (4) The estimates of the parameters may have some temporally correlated features and they can also vary spatially between different regions depending on the magnitude of the bias in the observed variables and other factors such as the intensity of the bloom period. We further show that the presented assimilation system has the potential to be used in global models.},

abstract = {Plants and vegetation play a critical—but largely unpredictable—role in global environmental changes due to the multitude of contributing processes at widely different spatial and temporal scales. In this Perspective, we explore approaches to master this complexity and improve our ability to predict vegetation dynamics by explicitly taking account of principles that constrain plant and ecosystem behaviour: natural selection, self-organization and entropy maximization. These ideas are increasingly being used in vegetation models, but we argue that their full potential has yet to be realized. We demonstrate the power of natural selection-based optimality principles to predict photosynthetic and carbon allocation responses to multiple environmental drivers, as well as how individual plasticity leads to the predictable self-organization of forest canopies. We show how models of natural selection acting on a few key traits can generate realistic plant communities and how entropy maximization can identify the most probable outcomes of community dynamics in space- and time-varying environments. Finally, we present a roadmap indicating how these principles could be combined in a new generation of models with stronger theoretical foundations and an improved capacity to predict complex vegetation responses to environmental change.},

The result from these methods can be too large, often by orders of magnitude, when the result is the derivative of a long time averaged quantity. This failure is known to be caused by ill-conditioned initial value problems. This paper overcomes this failure by replacing the initial value problem with the well-conditioned "least squares shadowing (LSS) problem". The LSS problem is then linearized in our sensitivity analysis algorithm, which computes a derivative that converges to the derivative of the infinitely long time average. We demonstrate our algorithm in several dynamical systems exhibiting both periodic and chaotic oscillations.},

abstract = {Reliability of terrestrial ecosystem models highly depends on the quantity and quality of the data that have been used to calibrate the models. Nowadays, in situ observations of carbon fluxes are abundant. However, the knowledge of how much data (data length) and which subset of the time series data (data period) should be used to effectively calibrate the model is still lacking. This study uses the AmeriFlux carbon flux data to parameterize the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) with an adjoint-based data assimilation technique for various ecosystem types. Parameterization experiments are thus conducted to explore the impact of both data length and data period on the uncertainty reduction of the posterior model parameters and the quantification of site and regional carbon dynamics. We find that: (1) the model is better constrained when it uses two-year data comparing to using one-year data. Further, two-year data is sufficient in calibrating TEM's carbon dynamics, since using three-year data could only marginally improve the model performance at our study sites; (2) the model is better constrained with the data that have a higher ''climate variability'' than that having a lower one. The climate variability is used to measure the overall possibility of the ecosystem to experience all climatic conditions including drought and extreme air temperatures and radiation; (3) the U.S. regional simulations indicate that the effect of calibration data length on carbon dynamics is amplified at regional and temporal scales, leading to large discrepancies among different parameterization experiments, especially in July and August. Our findings are conditioned on the specific model we used and the calibration sites we selected. The optimal calibration data length may not be suitable for other models. However, this study demonstrates that there may exist a threshold for calibration data length and simply using more data would not guarantee a better model parameterization and prediction. More importantly, climate variability might be an effective indicator of information within the data, which could help data selection for model parameterization. We believe our findings will benefit the ecosystem modeling community in using multiple-year data to improve model predictability.},

Tropical forests mitigate warming through evaporative cooling, but the low albedo of boreal forests is a positive climate forcing. The evaporative effect of temperate forests is unclear. The net climate forcing from these and other processes is not known. Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change.

abstract = {Darwinian evolution favours genotypes with high replication rates, a process called 'survival of the fittest'. However, knowing the replication rate of each individual genotype may not suffice to predict the eventual survivor, even in an asexual population. According to quasi-species theory, selection favours the cloud of genotypes, interconnected by mutation, whose average replication rate is highest. Here we confirm this prediction using digital organisms that self-replicate, mutate and evolve. Forty pairs of populations were derived from 40 different ancestors in identical selective environments, except that one of each pair experienced a 4-fold higher mutation rate. In 12 cases, the dominant genotype that evolved at the lower mutation rate achieved a replication rate > 1.5-fold faster than its counterpart. We allowed each of these disparate pairs to compete across a range of mutation rates. In each case, as mutation rate was increased, the outcome of competition switched to favour the genotype with the lower replication rate. These genotypes, although they occupied lower fitness peaks, were located in flatter regions of the fitness surface and were therefore more robust with respect to mutations.},

abstract = {Biogeochemical parameters remain a major source of uncertainty in coupled physical-biogeochemical models of the ocean. In a previous study (Doron et al., 2011), a stochastic estimation method was developed to estimate a subset of biogeochemical model parameters from surface phytoplankton observations. The concept was tested in the context of idealised twin experiments performed with a 1/4° resolution model of the North Atlantic ocean. The method was based on ensemble simulations describing the model response to parameter uncertainty. The statistical estimation process relies on nonlinear transformations of the estimated space to cope with the non-Gaussian behaviour of the resulting joint probability distribution of the model state variables and parameters. In the present study, the same method is applied to real ocean colour observations, as delivered by the sensors SeaWiFS, MERIS and MODIS embarked on the satellites OrbView-2, Envisat and Aqua respectively. The main outcome of the present experiments is a set of regionalised biogeochemical parameters. The benefit is quantitatively assessed with an objective norm of the misfits, which automatically adapts to the different ecological regions. The chlorophyll concentration simulated by the model with this set of optimally derived parameters is closer to the observations than the reference simulation using uniform values of the parameters. In addition, the interannual and seasonal robustness of the estimated parameters is tested by repeating the same analysis using ocean colour observations from several months and several years. The results show the overall consistency of the ensemble of estimated parameters, which are also compared to the results of an independent study. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Pahlow2008,
abstract = {Plankton ecosystems in the North Atlantic display strong regional and interannual variability in productivity and trophic structure, which cannot be captured by simple plankton models. Additional compartments subdividing functional groups can increase predictive power, but the high number of parameters tends to compromise portability and robustness of model predictions. An alternative strategy is to use property state variables, such as cell size, normally considered constant parameters in ecosystem models, to define the structure of functional groups in terms of both behaviour and response to physical forcing. This strategy may allow us to simulate realistically regional and temporal differences among plankton communities while keeping model complexity at a minimum. We fit a model of plankton and DOM dynamics globally and individually to observed climatologies at three diverse locations in the North Atlantic. Introducing additional property state variables is shown to improve the model fit both locally and globally, make the model more portable, and help identify model deficiencies. The zooplankton formulation exerts strong control on model performance. Our results suggest that the current paradigm on zooplankton allometric functional relationships might be at odds with observed plankton dynamics. Our parameter estimation resulted in more realistic estimates of parameters important for primary production than previous data assimilation studies. Property state variables generate complex emergent functional relationships, and might be used like tracers to differentiate between locally produced and advected biomass. The model results suggest that the observed temperature dependence of heterotrophic growth efficiency [Rivkin, R.B., Legendre, L., 2001. Biogenic carbon cycling in the upper ocean: effects of microbial respiration. Science 291 (5512) 2398-2400] could be an emergent relation due to intercorrelations among temperature, nutrient concentration and growth efficiency. A major advantage of using property state variables is that no additional parameters are required, such that differences in model performance can be directly related to model structure rather than parameter tuning. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Derivatives of differential equation solutions are commonly for parameter estimation, fitting neural differential equations, and as model diagnostics. However, with a litany of choices and a Cartesian product of potential methods, it can be difficult for practitioners to understand which method is likely to be the most effective on their particular application. In this manuscript we investigate the performance characteristics of Discrete Local Sensitivity Analysis implemented via Automatic Differentiation (DSAAD) against continuous adjoint sensitivity analysis. Non-stiff and stiff biological and pharmacometric models, including a PDE discretization, are used to quantify the performance of sensitivity analysis methods. Our benchmarks show that on small stiff and non-stiff systems of ODEs (approximately < 100 parameters+ODEs), forward-mode DSAAD is more efficient than both reverse-mode and continuous forward/adjoint sensitivity analysis. The scalability of continuous adjoint methods is shown to be more efficient than discrete adjoints and forward methods after crossing this size range. These comparative studies demonstrate a trade-off between memory usage and performance in the continuous adjoint methods that should be considered when choosing the technique, while numerically unstable backsolve techniques from the machine learning literature are demonstrated as unsuitable for most scientific models. The performance of adjoint methods is shown to be heavily tied to the reverse-mode AD method used for the vector-Jacobian product calculations, with tape-based AD methods shown to be 2 orders of magnitude slower on nonlinear partial differential equations than static AD techniques. In addition, these results demonstrate the out-of-The-box applicability of DSAAD to differential-Algebraic equations, delay differential equations, and hybrid differential equation systems where the event timing and effects are dependent on model parameters, showcasing an ease of implementation advantage for DSAAD approaches. Together, these benchmarks provide a guide to help practitioners to quickly identify the best mixture of continuous sensitivities and automatic differentiation for their applications.},

abstract = {Machine learning is increasingly recognized as a promising technology in the biological, biomedical, and behavioral sciences. There can be no argument that this technique is incredibly successful in image recognition with immediate applications in diagnostics including electrophysiology, radiology, or pathology, where we have access to massive amounts of annotated data. However, machine learning often performs poorly in prognosis, especially when dealing with sparse data. This is a field where classical physics-based simulation seems to remain irreplaceable. In this review, we identify areas in the biomedical sciences where machine learning and multiscale modeling can mutually benefit from one another: Machine learning can integrate physics-based knowledge in the form of governing equations, boundary conditions, or constraints to manage ill-posted problems and robustly handle sparse and noisy data; multiscale modeling can integrate machine learning to create surrogate models, identify system dynamics and parameters, analyze sensitivities, and quantify uncertainty to bridge the scales and understand the emergence of function. With a view towards applications in the life sciences, we discuss the state of the art of combining machine learning and multiscale modeling, identify applications and opportunities, raise open questions, and address potential challenges and limitations. We anticipate that it will stimulate discussion within the community of computational mechanics and reach out to other disciplines including mathematics, statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, biomedicine, systems biology, and precision medicine to join forces towards creating robust and efficient models for biological systems.},

abstract = {As systems approaches to the development of biological models become more mature, attention is increasingly focusing on the problem of inferring parameter values within those models from experimental data. However, particularly for nonlinear models, it is not obvious, either from inspection of the model or from the experimental data, that the inverse problem of parameter fitting will have a unique solution, or even a non-unique solution that constrains the parameters to lie within a plausible physiological range. Where parameters cannot be constrained they are termed ‘unidentifiable'. We focus on gaining insight into the causes of unidentifiability using inference-based methods, and compare a recently developed measure-theoretic approach to inverse sensitivity analysis to the popular Markov chain Monte Carlo and approximate Bayesian computation techniques for Bayesian inference. All three approaches map the uncertainty in quantities of interest in the output space to the probability of sets of parameters in the input space. The geometry of these sets demonstrates how unidentifiability can be caused by parameter compensation and provides an intuitive approach to inference-based experimental design.},

abstract = {Abstract. Recent progress in machine learning has shown how to forecast and, to some extent, learn the dynamics of a model from its output, resorting in particular to neural networks and deep learning techniques. We will show how the same goal can be directly achieved using data assimilation techniques without leveraging on machine learning software libraries, with a view to high-dimensional models. The dynamics of a model are learned from its observation and an ordinary differential equation (ODE) representation of this model is inferred using a recursive nonlinear regression. Because the method is embedded in a Bayesian data assimilation framework, it can learn from partial and noisy observations of a state trajectory of the physical model. Moreover, a space-wise local representation of the ODE system is introduced and is key to coping with high-dimensional models. It has recently been suggested that neural network architectures could be interpreted as dynamical systems. Reciprocally, we show that our ODE representations are reminiscent of deep learning architectures. Furthermore, numerical analysis considerations of stability shed light on the assets and limitations of the method. The method is illustrated on several chaotic discrete and continuous models of various dimensions, with or without noisy observations, with the goal of identifying or improving the model dynamics, building a surrogate or reduced model, or producing forecasts solely from observations of the physical model.},

abstract = {A new approach for data assimilation, which is based on the adjoint method, but allows the computer code for the adjoint to be constructed directly from the model computer code, is described. This technique is straightforward and reduces the chance of introducing errors in the construction of the adjoint code. Implementation of the technique is illustrated by applying it to a simple predator-prey model in a model fitting mode. A series of identical twin numerical experiments are used to show that this data assimilation approach can successfully recover model parameters as well as initial conditions. However, the ease with which these values are recovered is dependent on the form of the model equations as well as on the type and amount of data that are available. Additional numerical experiments show that sufficient coefficient and parameter recoveries are possible even when the assimilated data contain significant random noise. Thus, for biological systems that can be described by ecosystem models, the adjoint method represents a powerful approach for estimating values for little-known biological parameters, such as initial conditions, growth rates, and mortality rates.},

abstract = {A quantitative description of dynamical systems requires the estimation of uncertain kinetic parameters and an analysis of their precision. A method frequently used to describe the confidence intervals of estimated parameters is based on the Fisher-Information-Matrix. The application of this traditional method has two important shortcomings: (i) it gives only lower bounds for the variance of a parameter if the solution of the underlying model equations is non-linear in parameters. (ii) The resulting confidence interval is symmetric with respect to the estimated parameter. Here, we show that by applying the bootstrap method a better approximation of (possibly) asymmetric confidence intervals for parameters could be obtained. In contrast to previous applications devoted to non-parametric problems, a dynamical model describing a bio-chemical network is used to evaluate the method. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Dynamic models of mechatronic systems are abundantly used in the context of motion control and design of complex servo applications. In practice, these systems are often plagued by unknown interactions, which make the physics-based relations of the system dynamics only partially known. This paper presents a neural network augmented physics (NNAP) model as a combination of physics-inspired and neural layers. The neural layers are inserted in the model to compensate for the unmodeled interactions, without requiring direct measurements of these unknown phenomena. In contrast to traditional approaches, both the neural network and physical parameters are simultaneously optimized, solely by using state and control input measurements. The methodology is applied on experimental data of a slider-crank setup for which the state dependent load interactions are unknown. The NNAP model proves to be a stable and accurate modeling formalism for dynamic systems that ab initio can only be partially described by physical laws. Moreover, the results show that a recurrent implementation of the NNAP model enables improved robustness and accuracy of the system state predictions, compared to its feedforward counterpart. Besides capturing the system dynamics, the NNAP model provides a means to gain new insights by extracting the neural network from the converged NNAP model. In this way, we discovered accurate representations of the unknown spring force interaction and friction phenomena acting on the slider mechanism.},

abstract = {Statistical techniques exist for inferring community assembly processes from community patterns. Habitat filtering, competition, and biogeographical effects have, for example, been inferred from signals in phenotypic and phylogenetic data. The usefulness of current inference techniques is, however, debated as a mechanistic and causal link between process and pattern is often lacking, and evolutionary processes and trophic interactions are ignored. Here, we revisit the current knowledge on community assembly across scales and, in line with several reviews that have outlined challenges associated with current inference techniques, we identify a discrepancy between the current paradigm of eco-evolutionary community assembly and current inference techniques that focus mainly on competition and habitat filtering. We argue that trait-based dynamic eco-evolutionary models in combination with recently developed model fitting and model evaluation techniques can provide avenues for more accurate, reliable, and inclusive inference. To exemplify, we implement a trait-based, spatially explicit eco-evolutionary model and discuss steps of model modification, fitting, and evaluation as an iterative approach enabling inference from diverse data sources. Through a case study on inference of prey and predator niche width in an eco-evolutionary context, we demonstrate how inclusive and mechanistic approaches—eco-evolutionary modelling and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)—can enable inference of assembly processes that have been largely neglected by traditional techniques despite the ubiquity of such processes. Much literature points to the limitations of current inference techniques, but concrete solutions to such limitations are few. Many of the challenges associated with novel inference techniques are, however, already to some extent resolved in other fields and thus ready to be put into action in a more formal way for inferring processes of community assembly from signals in various data sources.},

abstract = {Successfully applying theoretical models to natural communities and predicting ecosystem behavior under changing conditions is the backbone of predictive ecology. However, the experiments required to test these models are dictated by practical constraints, and models are often opportunistically validated against data for which they were never intended. Alternatively, we can inform and improve experimental design by an in-depth pre-experimental analysis of the model, generating experiments better targeted at testing the validity of a theory. Here, we describe this process for a specific experiment. Starting from food web ecological theory, we formulate a model and design an experiment to optimally test the validity of the theory, supplementing traditional design considerations with model analysis. The experiment itself will be run and described in a separate paper. The theory we test is that trophic population dynamics are dictated by species traits, and we study this in a community of terrestrial arthropods. We depart from the Allometric Trophic Network (ATN) model and hypothesize that including habitat use, in addition to body mass, is necessary to better model trophic interactions. We therefore formulate new terms which account for micro-habitat use as well as intra- and interspecific interference in the ATN model. We design an experiment and an effective sampling regime to test this model and the underlying assumptions about the traits dominating trophic interactions. We arrive at a detailed sampling protocol to maximize information content in the empirical data obtained from the experiment and, relying on theoretical analysis of the proposed model, explore potential shortcomings of our design. Consequently, since this is a “pre-experimental” exercise aimed at improving the links between hypothesis formulation, model construction, experimental design and data collection, we hasten to publish our findings before analyzing data from the actual experiment, thus setting the stage for strong inference.},

abstract = {A major goal of evolutionary biology is to identify key evolutionary transitions that correspond with shifts in speciation and extinction rates. Stochastic character mapping has become the primary method used to infer the timing, nature, and number of character state transitions along the branches of a phylogeny. The method is widely employed for standard substitution models of characterevolution. However, current approaches cannot be used for models that specifically test the association of character state transitions with shifts in diversification rates such as state-dependent speciation and extinction (SSE) models. Herein, we introduce a new stochastic character mapping algorithm that overcomes these limitations, and apply it to study mating system evolution over a time-calibrated phylogeny of the plant family Onagraceae. Utilizing a hidden state SSE model we tested the association of the loss of self-incompatibility (SI) with shifts in diversification rates. We found that self-compatible lineages have higher extinction rates and lower net-diversification rates compared with self-incompatible lineages. Furthermore, these results provide empirical evidence for the "senescing" diversification rates predicted in highly selfing lineages: our mapped character histories show that the loss of SI is followed by a short-term spike in speciation rates, which declines after a time lag of several million years resulting in negative net-diversification. Lineages that have long been self-compatible, such as Fuchsia and Clarkia, are in a previously unrecognized and ongoing evolutionary decline. Our results demonstrate that stochastic character mapping of SSE models is a powerful tool for examining the timing and nature of both character state transitions and shifts in diversification rates over the phylogeny.},

Moreover, it is shown how recent attempts to measure meaningful Lyapunov exponents for ecological data are fundamentally flawed, and that when observational noise is convolved with process noise, computing Lyapunov exponents for the real system will be difficult. Such problems pave the way for more operational definitions of dynamic complexity (cf. Yao \& Tong, this volume) . Aside from its use in the characterization of chaos, nonlinear forecasting can be used more broadly in pragmatic classification problems. Here I review a recent example of nonlinear forecasting as it is applied to classify human heart rhythms. In particular, it is shown how forecast nonlinearity can be a good discriminator of the physiological effects of age, and how prediction-decay may discriminate heartdisease. In so doing, I introduce a method for characterizing nonlinearity using ‘S-maps' and a method for analysing multiple short time series with composite attractors.},

@article{Gutenkunst2007,
abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters, and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a growth-factor- signaling model that collective fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that the model had a "sloppy" spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities. We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions rather than on parameters. {\textcopyright} 2007 Gutenkunst et al.},

abstract = {It is well known that fluctuations of species abundances observed in ecological time series emerge from an interplay between deterministic nonlinear dynamics and stochastic forces. Importantly, nonlinearity and stochasticity introduce significant challenges to the analysis of ecological time series, such as the inference of the effect of species interactions on community dynamics and forecasting of species abundances. Local linear fits with state-space-dependent kernel functions, known as S-maps, provide an efficient method to infer Jacobian coefficients (a proxy for the local effect of species interactions) and to make reliable forecasts from nonlinear time series. Yet, while it has been shown that the S-map outperforms existing methods for nonparametric inference and forecasting, the methodology is sensitive to process noise. To overcome this limitation, we integrate the S-map with different regularization schemes. To validate our approach, we test our methodology against different levels of noise and nonlinearity using three standard population dynamics models. We show that an appropriate choice of the regularization scheme, alongside an accurate choice of the kernel functions, can significantly improve the in-sample inference of Jacobian coefficients and the out-of-sample forecast of species abundances in the presence of process noise. We further validate our methodology using two empirical time series of marine microbial communities. Our results illustrate that the regularized S-map is an efficient method for nonparametric inference and forecasting from noisy, nonlinear, ecological time series. Yet, attention must be paid on the regularization scheme and the structure of the kernel for whether inference or forecasting is the ultimate goal of a research study.},

@article{Brajard2021,
abstract = {In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been proposed to devise data-driven parametrizations of unresolved processes in dynamical numerical models. In most cases, the ML training leverages high-resolution simulations to provide a dense, noiseless target state. Our goal is to go beyond the use of high-resolution simulations and train ML-based parametrization using direct data, in the realistic scenario of noisy and sparse observations. The algorithm proposed in this work is a two-step process. First, data assimilation (DA) techniques are applied to estimate the full state of the system from a truncated model. The unresolved part of the truncated model is viewed as a model error in the DA system. In a second step, ML is used to emulate the unresolved part, a predictor of model error given the state of the system. Finally, the ML-based parametrization model is added to the physical core truncated model to produce a hybrid model. The DA component of the proposed method relies on an ensemble Kalman filter while the ML parametrization is represented by a neural network. The approach is applied to the two-scale Lorenz model and to MAOOAM, a reduced-order coupled ocean-atmosphere model. We show that in both cases, the hybrid model yields forecasts with better skill than the truncated model. Moreover, the attractor of the system is significantly better represented by the hybrid model than by the truncated model.

@article{Ward2010,
abstract = {Parameter values in marine biogeochemical models can strongly affect model performance, but can be hard to define accurately and precisely. When making quantitative comparisons between models it is helpful to objectively assign optimal parameter values, so it is the best model performance rather than the degree (or lack) of tuning which is assessed. The efficacy of two optimisation techniques, a variational adjoint (VA) and a micro genetic algorithm ($\mu$GA), was studied with respect to the calibration of two simple one-dimensional models for Arabian Sea data. Optimisations were randomly initialised a number of times, and given the level of uncertainty in the data, the two techniques performed equally well in terms of reducing model-data misfits. When ten parameters were optimised for either model, the Arabian Sea data were insufficient to constrain unique solutions; several parameters could be set anywhere across a wide range of values while providing a similarly good fit to the data. The significance of this underdetermination was assessed by evaluating model solutions against unassimilated equatorial Pacific data. When no prior information was used to assist the optimisation, the underdetermined solutions led to highly variable and often poor performance at the equatorial Pacific. Prior information was used to gain a more reliable solution in two ways: (1) by fixing all poorly-constrained parameters to their default prior values, optimising only parameters that were well-constrained by the data; or (2) by placing broad limits on the search to exclude unrealistic parameter values. Using the first approach the optimisation routines could constrain unique solutions and model performance in the equatorial Pacific was very consistent. The precise results were however sensitive to the uncertain a priori values of the fixed parameters. The second approach was less prescriptive, and consequently led to a more variable performance in the equatorial Pacific. It is argued that the first approach is unrealistically precise as it ignores any uncertainty in the unconstrained parameters, while solutions from the second approach may be unnecessarily broad. In conclusion, unconstrained parameter optimisation procedures should be assisted by stating all that is known a priori about the parameters, but no more. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recent theoretical studies have shown the potential for chaotic dynamics in simple three-species food chains. Most of these studies have focused on linear food chains, although natural food chains are seldom isolated from the surrounding food web. There is a growing awareness that food web dynamics can be strongly influenced by the behavior and movement of predators, energy, and nutrients across ecosystem and subecosystem boundaries. Motivated by observations from lakes, where the pelagic food web is often linked to the littoral food web by mobile predators, we constructed a simple model to evaluate the dynamics of two food chains linked by a top predator with prey preference. Linking the two food chains had no qualitative effect on model dynamics, although it did increase the density of the top predator. Instead, the prey preference of the top predator changed the system dynamics. We found a range of prey preferences that could eliminate chaos, dampen oscillations, and even produce point stability in a previously oscillatory system. The strength of prey preference required to produce a point attractor in a previously chaotic system was positively related to the dimension of chaos (a measure of the complexity of chaos). Our results suggest that, although chaos is possible in food webs, common processes like prey preference reduce the potential for chaos.},

However, only in the past century has the majority of the terrestrial biosphere been transformed into intensively used anthromes with predominantly novel anthropogenic ecological processes. At present, even were human populations to decline substantially or use of land become far more efficient, the current global extent, duration, type and intensity of human transformation of ecosystems have already irreversibly altered the terrestrial biosphere at levels sufficient to leave an unambiguous geological record differing substantially from that of the Holocene or any prior epoch.

abstract = {It is increasingly being recognized that global ecological research requires novel methods and strategies in which to combine process-based ecological models and data in cohesive, systematic ways. Model-data fusion (MDF) is an emerging area of research in ecology and palaeoecology. It provides a new quantitative approach that offers a high level of empirical constraint over model predictions based on observations using inverse modelling and data assimilation (DA) techniques. Increasing demands to integrate model and data methods in the past decade has led to MDF utilization in palaeoecology, ecology and earth system sciences. This paper reviews key features and principles of MDF and highlights different approaches with regards to DA. After providing a critical evaluation of the numerous benefits of MDF and its current applications in palaeoecology (i.e. palaeoclimatic reconstruction, palaeovegetation and palaeocarbon storage) and ecology (i.e. parameter and uncertainty estimation, model error identification, remote sensing and ecological forecasting), the paper discusses method limitations, current challenges and future research direction. In the ongoing data-rich era of today's world, MDF could become an important diagnostic and prognostic tool in which to improve our understanding of ecological processes while testing ecological theory and hypotheses and forecasting changes in ecosystem structure, function and services. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Coupling of several predator-prey oscillations can generate intriguing patterns of synchronization and chaos. Theory predicts that prey species will fluctuate in phase if predator-prey cycles are coupled through generalist predators, whereas they will fluctuate in anti-phase if predator-prey cycles are coupled through competition between prey species. Here, we investigate predator-prey oscillations in a long-term experiment with a marine plankton community. Wavelet analysis of the species fluctuations reveals two predator-prey cycles that fluctuate largely in anti-phase. The phase angles point at strong competition between the phytoplankton species, but relatively little prey overlap among the zooplankton species. This food web architecture is consistent with the size structure of the plankton community, and generates highly dynamic food webs. Continued alternations in species dominance enable coexistence of the prey species through a non-equilibrium 'killing-the-winner' mechanism, as the system shifts back and forth between the two predator-prey cycles in a chaotic fashion. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Residual neural networks can be viewed as the forward Euler discretization of an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) with a unit time step. This has recently motivated researchers to explore other discretization approaches and train ODE based networks. However, an important challenge of neural ODEs is their prohibitive memory cost during gradient backpropogation. Recently a method proposed in [Chen et al., 2018], claimed that this memory overhead can be reduced from O(LNt), where Nt is the number of time steps, down to O(L) by solving forward ODE backwards in time, where L is the depth of the network. However, we will show that this approach may lead to several problems: (i) it may be numerically unstable for ReLU/non-ReLU activations and general convolution operators, and (ii) the proposed optimize-then-discretize approach may lead to divergent training due to inconsistent gradients for small time step sizes. We discuss the underlying problems, and to address them we propose ANODE, an Adjoint based Neural ODE framework which avoids the numerical instability related problems noted above, and provides unconditionally accurate gradients. ANODE has a memory footprint of O(L) + O(Nt), with the same computational cost as reversing ODE solve. We furthermore, discuss a memory efficient algorithm which can further reduce this footprint with a trade-off of additional computational cost. We show results on Cifar-10/100 datasets using ResNet and SqueezeNext neural networks.},

abstract = {Neural networks have become increasingly prevalent within the geosciences, although a common limitation of their usage has been a lack of methods to interpret what the networks learn and how they make decisions. As such, neural networks have often been used within the geosciences to most accurately identify a desired output given a set of inputs, with the interpretation of what the network learns used as a secondary metric to ensure the network is making the right decision for the right reason. Neural network interpretation techniques have become more advanced in recent years, however, and we therefore propose that the ultimate objective of using a neural network can also be the interpretation of what the network has learned rather than the output itself. We show that the interpretation of neural networks can enable the discovery of scientifically meaningful connections within geoscientific data. In particular, we use two methods for neural network interpretation called backward optimization and layerwise relevance propagation, both of which project the decision pathways of a network back onto the original input dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, LRP has not yet been applied to geoscientific research, and we believe it has great potential in this area. We show how these interpretation techniques can be used to reliably infer scientifically meaningful information from neural networks by applying them to common climate patterns. These results suggest that combining interpretable neural networks with novel scientific hypotheses will open the door to many new avenues in neural network-related geoscience research.},

abstract = {The microbial part of the pelagic food web is believed to be a highly dynamic and tightly coupled network in which system behavior emerges from organism properties and interactions. A central goal in microbial ecology is a quantitative understanding of these interactions. A key aspect of these linkages is again the efficiency of food acquisition in the different groups of planktonic organisms. Here we estimate osmotrophic nutrient affinity for inorganic nitrogen and phagotrophic prey clearance values, using a parsimonious model of the microbial food web and modern Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The model is fitted to experimental data from five mesocosms filled with northern Baltic seawater containing an N-limited summer community and perturbed with different nutrient additions. The MCMC method successfully found one common set of parameters that not only gave a good fit to perturbation responses in all five mesocosms, but also was in reasonable agreement, both with values derived theoretically from first principles and allometric relationships, and with affinity values for phosphate in the experimental literature. Key properties of the structure and functioning of the microbial plankton food web can thus be derived and understood from fundamental physical- chemical laws governing affinity for nutrient uptake by osmotrophs, and size-selective grazing by key functional groups of phagotrophs. {\textcopyright} 2013, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Successfully predicting the future states of systems that are complex, stochastic, and potentially chaotic is a major challenge. Model forecasting error (FE) is the usual measure of success; however model predictions provide no insights into the potential for improvement. In short, the realized predictability of a specific model is uninformative about whether the system is inherently predictable or whether the chosen model is a poor match for the system and our observations thereof. Ideally, model proficiency would be judged with respect to the systems' intrinsic predictability, the highest achievable predictability given the degree to which system dynamics are the result of deterministic vs. stochastic processes. Intrinsic predictability may be quantified with permutation entropy (PE), a model-free, information-theoretic measure of the complexity of a time series. By means of simulations, we show that a correlation exists between estimated PE and FE and show how stochasticity, process error, and chaotic dynamics affect the relationship. This relationship is verified for a data set of 461 empirical ecological time series. We show how deviations from the expected PE–FE relationship are related to covariates of data quality and the nonlinearity of ecological dynamics. These results demonstrate a theoretically grounded basis for a model-free evaluation of a system's intrinsic predictability. Identifying the gap between the intrinsic and realized predictability of time series will enable researchers to understand whether forecasting proficiency is limited by the quality and quantity of their data or the ability of the chosen forecasting model to explain the data. Intrinsic predictability also provides a model-free baseline of forecasting proficiency against which modeling efforts can be evaluated.},

abstract = {Background: Dynamic modelling provides a systematic framework to understand function in biological systems. Parameter estimation in nonlinear dynamic models remains a very challenging inverse problem due to its nonconvexity and ill-conditioning. Associated issues like overfitting and local solutions are usually not properly addressed in the systems biology literature despite their importance. Here we present a method for robust and efficient parameter estimation which uses two main strategies to surmount the aforementioned difficulties: (i) efficient global optimization to deal with nonconvexity, and (ii) proper regularization methods to handle ill-conditioning. In the case of regularization, we present a detailed critical comparison of methods and guidelines for properly tuning them. Further, we show how regularized estimations ensure the best trade-offs between bias and variance, reducing overfitting, and allowing the incorporation of prior knowledge in a systematic way. Results: We illustrate the performance of the presented method with seven case studies of different nature and increasing complexity, considering several scenarios of data availability, measurement noise and prior knowledge. We show how our method ensures improved estimations with faster and more stable convergence. We also show how the calibrated models are more generalizable. Finally, we give a set of simple guidelines to apply this strategy to a wide variety of calibration problems. Conclusions: Here we provide a parameter estimation strategy which combines efficient global optimization with a regularization scheme. This method is able to calibrate dynamic models in an efficient and robust way, effectively fighting overfitting and allowing the incorporation of prior information.},

For phytoplankton, only a few resources are potentially limiting: nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, iron, light, inorganic carbon, and sometimes a few trace metals or vitamins. However, in natural waters dozens of phytoplankton species coexist 2. Here we offer a solution to the plankton paradox. First, we show that resource competition models 6-10 can generate oscillations and chaos when species compete for three or more resources. Second, we show that these oscillations and chaotic fluctuations in species abundances allow the coexistence of many species on a handful of resources. This model of planktonic biodiversity may be broadly applicable to the biodiversity of many ecosystems.},

abstract = {Statistical techniques exist for inferring community assembly processes from community patterns. Habitat filtering, competition, and biogeographical effects have, for example, been inferred from signals in phenotypic and phylogenetic data. The usefulness of current inference techniques is, however, debated as a mechanistic and causal link between process and pattern is often lacking, and evolutionary processes and trophic interactions are ignored. Here, we revisit the current knowledge on community assembly across scales and, in line with several reviews that have outlined challenges associated with current inference techniques, we identify a discrepancy between the current paradigm of eco-evolutionary community assembly and current inference techniques that focus mainly on competition and habitat filtering. We argue that trait-based dynamic eco-evolutionary models in combination with recently developed model fitting and model evaluation techniques can provide avenues for more accurate, reliable, and inclusive inference. To exemplify, we implement a trait-based, spatially explicit eco-evolutionary model and discuss steps of model modification, fitting, and evaluation as an iterative approach enabling inference from diverse data sources. Through a case study on inference of prey and predator niche width in an eco-evolutionary context, we demonstrate how inclusive and mechanistic approaches—eco-evolutionary modelling and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)—can enable inference of assembly processes that have been largely neglected by traditional techniques despite the ubiquity of such processes. Much literature points to the limitations of current inference techniques, but concrete solutions to such limitations are few. Many of the challenges associated with novel inference techniques are, however, already to some extent resolved in other fields and thus ready to be put into action in a more formal way for inferring processes of community assembly from signals in various data sources.},

abstract = {Nonlinear dynamic systems such as biochemical pathways can be represented in abstract form using a number of modelling formalisms. In particular differential equations provide a highly expressive mathematical framework with which to model dynamic systems, and a very natural way to model the dynamics of a biochemical pathway in a deterministic manner is through the use of nonlinear ordinary or time delay differential equations. However if, for example, we consider a biochemical pathway the constituent chemical species and hence the pathway structure are seldom fully characterised. In addition it is often impossible to obtain values of the rates of activation or decay which form the free parameters of the mathematical model. The system model in many cases is therefore not fully characterised either in terms of structure or the values which parameters take. This uncertainty must be accounted for in a systematic manner when the model is used in simulation or predictive mode to safeguard against reaching conclusions about system characteristics that are unwarranted, or in making predictions that are unjustifiably optimistic given the uncertainty about the model. The Bayesian inferential methodology provides a coherent framework with which to characterise and propagate uncertainty in such mechanistic models and this paper provides an introduction to Bayesian methodology as applied to system models represented as differential equations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Equilibrium- and model-based approaches have provided a theoretical framework with which to investigate this problem systematically. However, the applicability of this framework to empirical data has been limited because equilibrium dynamics of populations within communities are seldom observed in nature and exact equations for community dynamics are rarely known. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a data-driven non-parametric framework to estimate the tolerance of non-equilibrium community dynamics to environmental perturbations (that is, their structural stability). Following our approach, we show that in non-equilibrium systems, structural stability can vary significantly across time. As a case study, we investigate the structural stability of a rocky intertidal community with dynamics at the edge of chaos. The structural stability of the community as a whole exhibited a clear seasonal pattern, despite the persistent chaotic dynamics of individual populations. Importantly, we show that this seasonal pattern of structural stability is causally driven by sea temperature. Overall, our approach provides novel opportunities for estimating the tolerance of ecological communities to environmental changes within a non-parametric framework.},

abstract = {The present study describes a state-of-the-art methodology based on an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to facilitate efficient Bayesian sampling for realistic lower trophic level (LTL) marine ecosystem models. The main objective is to explore the ability to differentiate between biological parameters that can learn from observations and those that cannot. The Bayesian approach is applied to the northwestern coastal Gulf of Alaska region and uses both synthetic and actual (in situ and remotely sensed) observations. LTL ecosystem dynamics in the Bayesian framework are described by a process model consisting of a 1-dimensional Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detritus formulation with iron limitation (NPZDFe) and vertical mixing. The results illustrate the ability to determine parameter posterior distributions for fundamental biological rates, such as maximum phytoplankton growth or zooplankton grazing. By using various observational platforms as data stage inputs, the results also demonstrate the impact of spatial and temporal sampling on parameter posterior distributions, as well as the benefits of having concurrent measurements for two or more state variables of the process model (e.g., chlorophyll and nitrate concentrations). Extending the method to multiple parameters is non-trivial, as posterior distributions become impacted by correlated and/or disproportionate contributions for certain model parameters. Controlled experiments with "near perfect data" were useful to characterize parameter identifiability based on information content in the BHM data stage inputs, as well as to separate uncertainties due to sampling issues vs. uncertain ecosystem process interpretation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We compare the discretize-optimize (Disc-Opt) and optimize-discretize (Opt-Disc) approaches for time-series regression and continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) using neural ODEs. Neural ODEs are ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with neural network components. Training a neural ODE is an optimal control problem where the weights are the controls and the hidden features are the states. Every training iteration involves solving an ODE forward and another backward in time, which can require large amounts of computation, time, and memory. Comparing the Opt-Disc and Disc-Opt approaches in image classification tasks, Gholami et al. (2019) suggest that Disc-Opt is preferable due to the guaranteed accuracy of gradients. In this paper, we extend the comparison to neural ODEs for time-series regression and CNFs. Unlike in classification, meaningful models in these tasks must also satisfy additional requirements beyond accurate final-time output, e.g., the invertibility of the CNF. Through our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that with careful numerical treatment, Disc-Opt methods can achieve similar performance as Opt-Disc at inference with drastically reduced training costs. Disc-Opt reduced costs in six out of seven separate problems with training time reduction ranging from 39% to 97%, and in one case, Disc-Opt reduced training from nine days to less than one day.},

abstract = {We propose a new method for estimating parameters in models that are defined by a system of non-linear differential equations. Such equations represent changes in system outputs by linking the behaviour of derivatives of a process to the behaviour of the process itself. Current methods for estimating parameters in differential equations from noisy data are computationally intensive and often poorly suited to the realization of statistical objectives such as inference and interval estimation. The paper describes a new method that uses noisy measurements on a subset of variables to estimate the parameters defining a system of non-linear differential equations. The approach is based on a modification of data smoothing methods along with a generalization of profiled estimation. We derive estimates and confidence intervals, and show that these have low bias and good coverage properties respectively for data that are simulated from models in chemical engineering and neurobiology. The performance of the method is demonstrated by using real world data from chemistry and from the progress of the autoimmune disease lupus. {\textcopyright} 2007 Royal Statistical Society.},

@article{Raue2009,
abstract = {Motivation: Mathematical description of biological reaction networks by differential equations leads to large models whose parameters are calibrated in order to optimally explain experimental data. Often only parts of the model can be observed directly. Given a model that sufficiently describes the measured data, it is important to infer how well model parameters are determined by the amount and quality of experimental data. This knowledge is essential for further investigation of model predictions. For this reason a major topic in modeling is identifiability analysis. Results: We suggest an approach that exploits the profile likelihood. It enables to detect structural non-identifiabilities, which manifest in functionally related model parameters. Furthermore, practical non-identifiabilities are detected, that might arise due to limited amount and quality of experimental data. Last but not least confidence intervals can be derived. The results are easy to interpret and can be used for experimental planning and for model reduction. {\textcopyright} The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

Theory-guided data science (TGDS) is an emerging paradigm that aims to leverage the wealth of scientific knowledge for improving the effectiveness of data science models in enabling scientific discovery. The overarching vision of TGDS is to introduce scientific consistency as an essential component for learning generalizable models. Further, by producing scientifically interpretable models, TGDS aims to advance our scientific understanding by discovering novel domain insights. Indeed, the paradigm of TGDS has started to gain prominence in a number of scientific disciplines such as turbulence modeling, material discovery, quantum chemistry, bio-medical science, bio-marker discovery, climate science, and hydrology. In this paper, we formally conceptualize the paradigm of TGDS and present a taxonomy of research themes in TGDS. We describe several approaches for integrating domain knowledge in different research themes using illustrative examples from different disciplines. We also highlight some of the promising avenues of novel research for realizing the full potential of theory-guided data science.},

abstract = {Analysing the properties of a biological system through in silico experimentation requires a satisfactory mathematical representation of the system including accurate values of the model parameters. Fortunately, modern experimental techniques allow obtaining time-series data of appropriate quality which may then be used to estimate unknown parameters. However, in many cases, a subset of those parameters may not be uniquely estimated, independently of the experimental data available or the numerical techniques used for estimation. This lack of identifiability is related to the structure of the model, i.e. the system dynamics plus the observation function. Despite the interest in knowing a priori whether there is any chance of uniquely estimating all model unknown parameters, the structural identifiability analysis for general non-linear dynamic models is still an open question. There is no method amenable to every model, thus at some point we have to face the selection of one of the possibilities. This work presents a critical comparison of the currently available techniques. To this end, we perform the structural identifiability analysis of a collection of biological models. The results reveal that the generating series approach, in combination with identifiability tableaus, offers the most advantageous compromise among range of applicability, computational complexity and information provided. {\textcopyright} 2011 Chis et al.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are powerful tools to project past, current and future vegetation patterns and associated biogeochemical cycles. However, most models are limited by how they define vegetation and by their simplistic representation of competition. We discuss how concepts from community assembly theory and coexistence theory can help to improve vegetation models. We further present a trait- and individual-based vegetation model (aDGVM2) that allows individual plants to adopt a unique combination of trait values. These traits define how individual plants grow and compete. A genetic optimization algorithm is used to simulate trait inheritance and reproductive isolation between individuals. These model properties allow the assembly of plant communities that are adapted to a site's biotic and abiotic conditions. The aDGVM2 simulates how environmental conditions influence the trait spectra of plant communities; that fire selects for traits that enhance fire protection and reduces trait diversity; and the emergence of life-history strategies that are suggestive of colonization-competition trade-offs. The aDGVM2 deals with functional diversity and competition fundamentally differently from current DGVMs. This approach may yield novel insights as to how vegetation may respond to climate change and we believe it could foster collaborations between functional plant biologists and vegetation modellers. {\textcopyright} 2013 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract = {Modelers often need to quantify the rates at which zooplankton consume a variety of species, size classes and trophic types. Implicit in the equations used to describe the multiple resource functional response (i.e. how nutritional intake varies with resource densities) are assumptions that are not often stated, let alone tested. This is problematic because models are sensitive to the details of these formulations. Here, we enable modelers to make more informed decisions by providing them with a new framework for considering zooplankton feeding on multiple resources. We define a new classification of multiple resource responses that is based on preference, selection and switching, and we develop a set of mathematical diagnostics that elucidate model assumptions. We use these tools to evaluate the assumptions and biological dynamics inherent in published multiple resource responses. These models are shown to simulate different resource preferences, implied single resource responses, changes in intake with changing resource densities, nutritional benefits of generalism, and nutritional costs of selection. Certain formulations are further shown to exhibit anomalous dynamics such as negative switching and sub-optimal feeding. Such varied responses can have vastly different ecological consequences for both zooplankton and their resources; inappropriate choices may incorrectly quantify biologically-mediated fluxes and predict spurious dynamics. We discuss how our classes and diagnostics can help constrain parameters, interpret behaviors, and identify limitations to a formulation's applicability for both regional (e.g. High-Nitrate-Low- Chlorophyll regions comprising large areas of the Pacific) and large-scale applications (e.g. global biogeochemical or climate change models). Strategies for assessing uncertainty and for using the mathematics to guide future experimental investigations are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Yet ecological understanding of ecosystem services is quite limited. Previous work maps the supply and demand for services, assesses threats to them, and estimates economic values, but does not measure the underlying role of biodiversity in providing services. In contrast, experimental studies of biodiversity-function examine communities whose structures often differ markedly from those providing services in real landscapes. A bridge is needed between these two approaches. To develop this research agenda, I discuss critical questions and key approaches in Four areas: (1) identifying the important 'ecosystem service providers'; (2) determining the various aspects of community structure that influence function in real landscapes, especially compensatory community responses that stabilize function, or non-random extinction sequences that rapidly erode it; (3) assessing key environmental factors influencing provision of services, and (4) measuring the spatio-temporal scale over which providers and services operate.

abstract = {Under equilibrium conditions, previous theory has shown that the presence of omnivory destabilizes food webs. Correspondingly, omnivory ought to be rare in real food webs. Although early food-web data appeared to verify this, recently many ecologists have found omnivory to be ubiquitous in food-web data gathered at a high taxonomic resolution. In this paper, we reinvestigate the role of omnivory in food webs using a non-equilibrium perspective. We find that the addition of omnivory to a simple food-chain model (thus a simple food web) locally stabilizes the food web in a very complete way. First, non-equilibrium dynamics (e.g. chaos) tend to be eliminated or bounded further away from zero, via period-doubling reversals invoked by the omnivorous trophic link. Second, food chains without interior attractors tend to gain a stable interior attractor with moderate amounts of omnivory.},

abstract = {New and improved estimates of sea ice production in the Arctic Ocean are derived from AMSR- E satellite and atmospheric reanalysis data for the period 2002–2011, at a spatial resolution of 6.25 km and using a newly developed fast-ice mask. High ice production in the major coastal polynyas is well demon- strated. The total annual cumulative ice production in the major 10 polynya regions is about 1180±70km3. The interannual variability of the ice production for each polynya is presented during 2002–2011. No obvious relationship is noted between the ice production and the recent drastic reduction in the preceding summer Arctic sea ice extent. Most polynya regions exhibit maximum ice production in autumn (October – November), before areas offshore have been covered with consolidated pack ice. Sea ice production from October to November in the marginal ice zone of the Pacific Ocean sector is negatively correlated with summer ice extent there. The ice production from October to November of 2007 (a record minimum summer ice extent) was about twice as large as that in other years. The high ice production area shifted to higher latitudes i.e., toward the deep Canada Basin, due to the retreat of the summer ice edge. We speculate that the resultant increase in brine input could change the oceanic structure in the basin, specifically deep- ening the winter mixed layer.},

Twin experiments are conducted in a 1D ecological model. Surface phytoplankton data are used, with 30% log-normally distributed measurement error. Three parameters are chosen for calibration.

abstract = {Applied ecology has traditionally approached management problems through a simplified, single-species lens. Repeated failures of single-species management have led us to a new paradigm — managing at the ecosystem level. Ecosystem management involves a complex array of interacting organisms, processes and scientific disciplines. Accounting for interactions, feedback loops and dependencies between ecosystem components is therefore fundamental to understanding and managing ecosystems. We provide an overview of the main types of ecosystem models and their uses, and discuss challenges related to modelling complex ecological systems. Existing modelling approaches typically attempt to do one or more of the following: describe and disentangle ecosystem components and interactions; make predictions about future ecosystem states; and inform decision making by comparing alternative strategies and identifying important uncertainties. Modelling ecosystems is challenging, particularly when balancing the desire to represent many components of an ecosystem with the limitations of available data and the modelling objective. Explicitly considering different forms of uncertainty is therefore a primary concern. We provide some recommended strategies (such as ensemble ecosystem models and multi-model approaches) to aid the explicit consideration of uncertainty while also meeting the challenges of modelling ecosystems.},

Furthermore an extension of the ensemble Kalman filter to transformed Gaussian variables is presented and illustrated using a simplified ecological model. The described methods are designed for predicting over geographical regions using a high spatial resolution under the practical constraint of keeping computing time sufficiently low to obtain the prediction before the fact.

These developments are widely viewed as an important step in developing greater realism in predictions of future ecosystem states and fluxes. Increased realism, however, leads to increased model complexity, with new features raising a suite of ecological questions that require empirical constraints. Here, we review the developments that permit the representation of plant demographics in ESMs, and identify issues raised by these developments that highlight important gaps in ecological understanding. These issues inevitably translate into uncertainty in model projections but also allow models to be applied to new processes and questions concerning the dynamics of real-world ecosystems. We argue that stronger and more innovative connections to data, across the range of scales considered, are required to address these gaps in understanding. The development of first-generation land surface models as a unifying framework for ecophysiological understanding stimulated much research into plant physiological traits and gas exchange. Constraining predictions at ecologically relevant spatial and temporal scales will require a similar investment of effort and intensified inter-disciplinary communication.},

In this paper, we construct optimal O 2 and CO 2 gas input profiles to estimate the respiration and fermentation kinetics of pear fruit. The optimal input profiles, however, depend on the true values of the respiration and fermentation parameters. Locally optimal design of input profiles, which uses a single initial guess for the parameters, is the traditional method to deal with this issue.

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are statistical models suited for learning complex visual patterns. In the context of Species Distribution Models (SDM) and in line with predictions of landscape ecology and island biogeography, CNN could grasp how local landscape structure affects prediction of species occurrence in SDMs. The prediction can thus reflect the signatures of entangled ecological processes. Although previous machine-learning based SDMs can learn complex influences of environmental predictors, they cannot acknowledge the influence of environmental structure in local landscapes (hence denoted “punctual models”). In this study, we applied CNNs to a large dataset of plant occurrences in France (GBIF), on a large taxonomical scale, to predict ranked relative probability of species (by joint learning) to any geographical position. We examined the way local environmental landscapes improve prediction by performing alternative CNN models deprived of information on landscape heterogeneity and structure (“ablation experiments”). We found that the landscape structure around location crucially contributed to improve predictive performance of CNN-SDMs. CNN models can classify the predicted distributions of many species, as other joint modelling approaches, but they further prove efficient in identifying the influence of local environmental landscapes. CNN can then represent signatures of spatially structured environmental drivers. The prediction gain is noticeable for rare species, which open promising perspectives for biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies. Therefore, the approach is of both theoretical and practical interest. We discuss the way to test hypotheses on the patterns learnt by CNN, which should be essential for further interpretation of the ecological processes at play.},

@article{Schartau2017,
abstract = {Abstract. To describe the underlying processes involved in oceanic plankton dynamics is crucial for the determination of energy and mass flux through an ecosystem and for the estimation of biogeochemical element cycling. Many planktonic ecosystem models were developed to resolve major processes so that flux estimates can be derived from numerical simulations. These results depend on the type and number of parameterizations incorporated as model equations. Furthermore, the values assigned to respective parameters specify a model's solution. Representative model results are those that can explain data; therefore, data assimilation methods are utilized to yield optimal estimates of parameter values while fitting model results to match data. Central difficulties are (1) planktonic ecosystem models are imperfect and (2) data are often too sparse to constrain all model parameters. In this review we explore how problems in parameter identification are approached in marine planktonic ecosystem modelling. We provide background information about model uncertainties and estimation methods, and how these are considered for assessing misfits between observations and model results. We explain differences in evaluating uncertainties in parameter estimation, thereby also discussing issues of parameter identifiability. Aspects of model complexity are addressed and we describe how results from cross-validation studies provide much insight in this respect. Moreover, approaches are discussed that consider time- and space-dependent parameter values. We further discuss the use of dynamical/statistical emulator approaches, and we elucidate issues of parameter identification in global biogeochemical models. Our review discloses many facets of parameter identification, as we found many commonalities between the objectives of different approaches, but scientific insight differed between studies. To learn more from results of planktonic ecosystem models we recommend finding a good balance in the level of sophistication between mechanistic modelling and statistical data assimilation treatment for parameter estimation.},

abstract = {Most ecosystem functions and related services involve species interactions across trophic levels, for example, pollination and biological pest control. Despite this, our understanding of ecosystem function in multitrophic communities is poor, and research has been limited to either manipulation in small communities or statistical descriptions in larger ones. Recent advances in food web ecology may allow us to overcome the trade-off between mechanistic insight and ecological realism. Molecular tools now simplify the detection of feeding interactions, and trait-based approaches allow the application of dynamic food web models to real ecosystems. We performed the first test of an allometric food web model's ability to replicate temporally nonaggregated abundance data from the field and to provide mechanistic insight into the function of predation. We aimed to reproduce and explore the drivers of the population dynamics of the aphid herbivore Rhopalosiphum padi observed in ten Swedish barley fields. We used a dynamic food web model, taking observed interactions and abundances of predators and alternative prey as input data, allowing us to examine the role of predation in aphid population control. The inverse problem methods were used for simultaneous model fit optimization and model parameterization. The model captured >70% of the variation in aphid abundance in five of ten fields, supporting the model-embodied hypothesis that body size can be an important determinant of predation in the arthropod community. We further demonstrate how in-depth model analysis can disentangle the likely drivers of function, such as the community's abundance and trait composition. Analysing the variability in model performance revealed knowledge gaps, such as the source of episodic aphid mortality, and general method development needs that, if addressed, would further increase model success and enable stronger inference about ecosystem function. The results demonstrate that confronting dynamic food web models with abundance data from the field is a viable approach to evaluate ecological theory and to aid our understanding of function in real ecosystems. However, to realize the full potential of food web models, in ecosystem function research and beyond, trait-based parameterization must be refined and extended to include more traits than body size.},

abstract = {We examined the factors that determine the citations of 153 mechanistic aquatic biogeochemical modeling papers published from 1990 to 2002. Our analysis provides overwhelming evidence that ocean modeling is a dynamic area of the current modeling practice. Models developed to gain insight into the ocean carbon cycle/marine biogeochemistry are most highly cited, the produced knowledge is exported to other cognitive disciplines, and oceanic modelers are less reluctant to embrace technical advances (e.g., assimilation schemes) and more critically increase model complexity. Contrary to our predictions, model application for environmental management issues on a local scale seems to have languished; the pertinent papers comprise a smaller portion of the published modeling literature and receive lower citations. Given the critical planning information that these models aim to provide, we hypothesize that the latter finding probably stems from conceptual weaknesses, methodological omissions, and an evident lack of haste from modelers to adopt new ideas in their repertoire when addressing environmental management issues. We also highlight the lack of significant association between citation frequency and model complexity, model performance, implementation of conventional methodological steps during model development (e.g., validation, sensitivity analysis), number of authors, and country of affiliation. While these results cast doubt on the rationale of the current modeling practice, the fact that the Fasham et al. (1990) paper has received over 400 citations probably dictates what should be done from the modeling community to meet the practical need for attractive and powerful modeling tools. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

These data enable users to calculate temporal trends in biodiversity within and amongst assemblages using a broad range of metrics. BioTIME is being developed as a community-led open-source database of biodiversity time series. Our goal is to accelerate and facilitate quantitative analysis of temporal patterns of biodiversity in the Anthropocene. Main types of variables included: The database contains 8,777,413 species abundance records, from assemblages consistently sampled for a minimum of 2 years, which need not necessarily be consecutive. In addition, the database contains metadata relating to sampling methodology and contextual information about each record. Spatial location and grain: BioTIME is a global database of 547,161 unique sampling locations spanning the marine, freshwater and terrestrial realms. Grain size varies across datasets from 0.0000000158 km2 (158 cm2) to 100 km2 (1,000,000,000,000 cm2). Time period and grain: BioTIME records span from 1874 to 2016. The minimal temporal grain across all datasets in BioTIME is a year. Major taxa and level of measurement: BioTIME includes data from 44,440 species across the plant and animal kingdoms, ranging from plants, plankton and terrestrial invertebrates to small and large vertebrates.

@article{Dennis2001,
abstract = {A defining hypothesis of theoretical ecology during the past century has been that population fluctuations might largely be explained by relatively low-dimensional, nonlinear ecological interactions, provided such interactions could be correctly identified and modeled. The realization in recent decades that such nonlinear interactions might result in chaos and other exotic dynamic behaviors has been exciting but tantalizing, in that attributing the fluctuations of a particular real population to the complex dynamics of a particular mathematical model has proved to be an elusive goal. We experimentally tested a model-predicted sequence of transitions (bifurcations) in the dynamic behavior of a population from stable equilibria to quasiperiodic and periodic cycles to chaos to three-cycles using cultures of the flour beetle Tribolium. The predictions arose from a system of difference equations (the LPA model) describing the nonlinear life-stage interactions, predominantly cannibalism. We built a stochastic version of the model incorporating demographic variability and obtained conditional least-squares estimates for the model parameters. We generated 2000 "bootstrapped data Sets" with a time-series bootstrap technique, and for each set we reestimated the model parameters. The resulting 2000 bootstrapped parameter vectors were used to obtain confidence intervals for the model parameters and estimated distributions of the Liapunov exponents for the deterministic portion (the skeleton) of the model as well as for the full stochastic model. Frequency distributions of estimated dynamic behaviors of the skeleton at each experimental treatment were produced. For one treatment, over 83% of the bootstrapped parameter estimates corresponded to chaotic attractors, and the remainder of the estimates yielded high-period cycles. The low-dimensional skeleton accounted for at least 90% of the variability in the population abundances and accurately described the responses of populations to experimental demographic manipulations, including treatments for which the predicted dynamic behavior was chaos. Demographic stochasticity described the remaining noise quite well. We conclude that the fluctuations of experimental flour beetle populations are explained largely by known nonlinear forces involving cannibalistic-stage interactions. Claims of dynamic behavior such as periodic cycles or chaos must be accompanied by a consideration of the reliability of the estimated parameters and a realization that the population fluctuations are a blend of deterministic forces and stochastic events.},

Predictive models for cells or whole organisms could ultimately lead to model-based predictive and/or preventive medicine.

Genome Res. 13, 2467-2474], the challenging nature of such inverse problems was highlighted considering a benchmark problem, and concluding that only a certain type of stochastic global optimisation method, Evolution Strategies (ES), was able to solve it successfully, although at a rather large computational cost. In this new contribution, we present a new integrated optimisation methodology with a number of very significant improvements: (i) computation time is reduced by one order of magnitude by means of a hybrid method which increases efficiency while guaranteeing robustness, (ii) measurement noise (errors) and partial observations are handled adequately, (iii) automatic testing of identifiability of the model (both local and practical) is included and (iv) the information content of the experiments is evaluated via the Fisher information matrix, with subsequent application to design of new optimal experiments through dynamic optimisation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {We propose a new method for estimating parameters in models that are defined by a system of non-linear differential equations. Such equations represent changes in system outputs by linking the behaviour of derivatives of a process to the behaviour of the process itself. Current methods for estimating parameters in differential equations from noisy data are computationally intensive and often poorly suited to the realization of statistical objectives such as inference and interval estimation. The paper describes a new method that uses noisy measurements on a subset of variables to estimate the parameters defining a system of non-linear differential equations. The approach is based on a modification of data smoothing methods along with a generalization of profiled estimation. We derive estimates and confidence intervals, and show that these have low bias and good coverage properties respectively for data that are simulated from models in chemical engineering and neurobiology. The performance of the method is demonstrated by using real world data from chemistry and from the progress of the autoimmune disease lupus. {\textcopyright} 2007 Royal Statistical Society.},

abstract = {Mathematical models predict that species interactions such as competition and predation can generate chaos. However, experimental demonstrations of chaos in ecology are scarce, and have been limited to simple laboratory systems with a short duration and artificial species combinations. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of chaos in a long-term experiment with a complex food web. Our food web was isolated from the Baltic Sea, and consisted of bacteria, several phytoplankton species, herbivorous and predatory zooplankton species, and detritivores. The food web was cultured in a laboratory mesocosm, and sampled twice a week for more than 2,300 days. Despite constant external conditions, the species abundances showed striking fluctuations over several orders of magnitude. These fluctuations displayed a variety of different periodicities, which could be attributed to different species interactions in the food web. The population dynamics were characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents of similar magnitude for each species. Predictability was limited to a time horizon of 15-30 days, only slightly longer than the local weather forecast. Hence, our results demonstrate that species interactions in food webs can generate chaos. This implies that stability is not required for the persistence of complex food webs, and that the long-term prediction of species abundances can be fundamentally impossible. {\textcopyright}2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

Though detectable in principle, nonlinear behavior is often difficult to characterize, analyze, and incorporate mechanistically into models of ecosystem function. One obvious reason is that quantitative nonlinear analysis tools are data intensive (require long time series), and time series in ecology are generally short. Here we demonstrate a useful method that circumvents data limitation and reduces sampling error by combining ecologically similar multispecies time series into one long time series. With this technique, individual ecological time series containing as few as 20 data points can be mined for such important information as (1) significantly improved forecast ability, (2) the presence and location of nonlinearity, and (3) the effective dimensionality (the number of relevant variables) of an ecological system. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The University of Chicago.

abstract = {Empirical time series of interacting entities, e.g., species abundances, are highly useful to study ecological mechanisms. Mathematical models are valuable tools to further elucidate those mechanisms and underlying processes. However, obtaining an agreement between model predictions and experimental observations remains a demanding task. As models always abstract from reality one parameter often summarizes several properties. Parameter measurements are performed in additional experiments independent of the ones delivering the time series. Transferring these parameter values to different settings may result in incorrect parametrizations. On top of that, the properties of organisms and thus the respective parameter values may vary considerably. These issues limit the use of a priori model parametrizations. In this study, we present a method suited for a direct estimation of model parameters and their variability from experimental time series data. We combine numerical simulations of a continuous-time dynamical population model with Bayesian inference, using a hierarchical framework that allows for variability of individual parameters. The method is applied to a comprehensive set of time series from a laboratory predator-prey system that features both steady states and cyclic population dynamics. Our model predictions are able to reproduce both steady states and cyclic dynamics of the data. Additionally to the direct estimates of the parameter values, the Bayesian approach also provides their uncertainties. We found that fitting cyclic population dynamics, which contain more information on the process rates than steady states, yields more precise parameter estimates. We detected significant variability among parameters of different time series and identified the variation in the maximum growth rate of the prey as a source for the transition from steady states to cyclic dynamics. By lending more flexibility to the model, our approach facilitates parametrizations and shows more easily which patterns in time series can be explained also by simple models. Applying Bayesian inference and dynamical population models in conjunction may help to quantify the profound variability in organismal properties in nature.},

Multi-experiment-fitting is a powerful approach to estimate parameter values, to check the validity of a given model, and to discriminate competing model hypotheses. It requires high-performance integration of ordinary differential equations and robust optimization. Results: We here present the comprehensive modeling framework Potters-Wheel (PW) including novel functionalities to satisfy these requirements with strong emphasis on the inverse problem, i.e. data-based modeling of partially observed and noisy systems like signal transduction pathways and metabolic networks. PW is designed as a MATLAB toolbox and includes numerous user interfaces. Deterministic and stochastic optimization routines are combined by fitting in logarithmic parameter space allowing for robust parameter calibration. Model investigation includes statistical tests for model-data-compliance, model discrimination, identifiability analysis and calculation of Hessian- and Monte-Carlo-based parameter confidence limits. A rich application programming interface is available for customization within own MATLAB code. Within an extensive performance analysis, we identified and significantly improved an integrator-optimizer pair which decreases the fitting duration for a realistic benchmark model by a factor over 3000 compared to MATLAB with optimization toolbox. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Biodiversity has both fascinated and puzzled biologists. In aqua-tic ecosystems, the biodiversity puzzle is particularly trouble-some, and known as the ‘paradox of the plankton' Competition theory predicts that, at equilibrium, the number of coexisting species cannot exceed the number of limiting resources . For phytoplankton, only a few resources are potentially limiting: nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, iron, light, inorganic carbon, and sometimes a few trace metals or vitamins. However, in natural waters dozens of phytoplankton species coexist . Here we offer a solution to the plankton paradox. First, we show that resource competition models can generate oscillations and chaos when species compete for three or more resources. Second, we show that these oscillations and chaotic fluctuations in species abundances allow the coexistence of many species on a handful of resources. This model of planktonic biodiversity may be broadly applicable to the biodiversity of many ecosystems.},

abstract = {Mesocosm experiments have played an important role over the last decade in increasing our understanding of marine ecosystems. Many studies use these controlled environments to examine ecosystem responses to factors such as nutrient addition and light limitation. A few studies have been able to successfully model mesocosm experiments using carefully designed and comprehensive models and experimental design. Nevertheless, it is rare for such models to be compared with oceanic studies, and to consider the sulphur cycle as well as the carbon and nitrogen budgets. Here we take an ecosystem model, including a dimethylsulphide loop, that has been successfully used in modelling the evolution of the planktonic system in a Lagrangian field experiment in the North Atlantic - the PRIME cruise of 1996 - and apply it to two mesocosm experiments. These were operated by two different groups of scientists, but in the same field station in a Norwegian fjord. The experiments were not explicitly designed with the data requirements of any model in mind. We show that the model is best able to simulate mesocosm data using model parameters taken from the real ocean. However, most sensitivity tests are significantly less successful in the mesocosm environment than the real ocean, especially if the model parameters are allowed to vary in a best fit sense. The limitations of the model-mesocosm match highlight the importance of comprehensive monitoring of mesocosms if they are to be useful for validating models suitable for the open ocean.},

However, these more realistic models require detailed information, which is lacking for most species on Earth. Current monitoring efforts mainly document changes in biodiversity, rather than collecting the mechanistic data needed to predict future changes. We describe and prioritize the biological information needed to inform more realistic projections of species' responses to climate change. We also highlight how trait-based approaches and adaptive modeling can leverage sparse data to make broader predictions. We outline a global effort to collect the data necessary to better understand, anticipate, and reduce the damaging effects of climate change on biodiversity.},

@article{Norberg2012,
abstract = {Climate change is predicted to alter global species diversity, the distribution of human pathogens and ecosystem services. Forecasting these changes and designing adequate management of future ecosystem services will require predictive models encompassing the most fundamental biotic responses. However, most present models omit important processes such as evolution and competition. Here we develop a spatially explicit eco-evolutionary model of multi-species responses to climate change. We demonstrate that both dispersal and evolution differentially mediate extinction risks and biodiversity alterations through time and across climate gradients. Together, high genetic variance and low dispersal best minimized extinction risks. Surprisingly, high dispersal did not reduce extinctions, because the shifting ranges of some species hastened the decline of others. Evolutionary responses dominated during the later stages of climatic changes and in hot regions. No extinctions occurred without competition, which highlights the importance of including species interactions in global biodiversity models. Most notably, climate change created extinction and evolutionary debts, with changes in species richness and traits occurring long after climate stabilization. Therefore, even if we halt anthropogenic climate change today, transient eco-evolutionary dynamics would ensure centuries of additional alterations in global biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

@article{Purves2013,
abstract = {On 14 July 1991, at 2150 h, a train derailment occurred near the Cantara rail curve about six miles above Dunsmuir in Northern California. The derailment spilled approximately 19,000 gallons of metam-sodium into the Sacramento River. When mixed with water, metam-sodium degrades to methylisothiocyanate (MITC) and other gases. The contaminated river water passed the town of Dunsmuir and other occupied areas exposing residents to MITC gas. From 15 July to 20 July (five days), a total of 360 people underwent triage. The majority of patients displayed minor exposure symptoms that did not require hospital care. Mercy Mt. Shasta Hospital, a small rural hospital close to Dunsmuir, received the majority of patients. As of 29 July, 15 days after the incident, Mercy Mt. Shasta Hospital had seen 244 exposed patients in its emergency department, and had admitted five. Three had symptoms that could have been spill-related. Three Regional Poison Control Centers provided medical toxicology advice. Medical management of the emergency medical services (EMS) response to the event was piecemeal and weak. There did not appear to be a medical operations component at local Emergency Operations Centers (EOC). Most health care personnel interviewed complained about inadequate information about the substance and the situation. Local fire service mutual- aid agreements to obtain additional fire service and ambulance personnel worked well. It is important to emphasize that everyone who believed they had been exposed to the chemical underwent triage and received appropriate acute medical care.},

abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a novel method of assessing biodiversity wherein samples are taken from the environment via water, sediment or air from which DNA is extracted, and then amplified using general or universal primers in polymerase chain reaction and sequenced using next-generation sequencing to generate thousands to millions of reads. From this data, species presence can be determined, and overall biodiversity assessed. It is an interdisciplinary method that brings together traditional field-based ecology with in-depth molecular methods and advanced computational tools. As an emerging monitoring method, there are many pitfalls and roadblocks to be considered and avoided, but the method may still have the ability to revolutionize modern biodiversity surveys for the molecular era. In this paper, we review the basic methodology, benefits, and concerns of eDNA metabarcoding, and systematically cover the applications of the method in global ecology thus far, including biodiversity monitoring across all habitats and taxonomic groups, ancient ecosystem reconstruction, plant-pollinator interactions, diet analysis, invasive species detection, pollution responses, and air quality monitoring. We also discuss the future applications of the method as well as expected technological advances and how they may impact the way that eDNA metabarcoding may used in the future. eDNA metabarcoding is a unique method still in development and will likely remain in flux for some time as technology advances and procedures become standardized. However, as metabarcoding is optimized and its use becomes more widespread, it is likely to become an essential tool for ecological monitoring and global conservation study.},

abstract = {Species distributions and abundances are undergoing rapid changes worldwide. This highlights the significance of reliable, integrated information for guiding and assessing actions and policies aimed at managing and sustaining the many functions and benefits of species. Here we synthesize the types of data and approaches that are required to achieve such an integration and conceptualize ‘essential biodiversity variables' (EBVs) for a unified global capture of species populations in space and time. The inherent heterogeneity and sparseness of raw biodiversity data are overcome by the use of models and remotely sensed covariates to inform predictions that are contiguous in space and time and global in extent. We define the species population EBVs as a space–time–species–gram (cube) that simultaneously addresses the distribution or abundance of multiple species, with its resolution adjusted to represent available evidence and acceptable levels of uncertainty. This essential information enables the monitoring of single or aggregate spatial or taxonomic units at scales relevant to research and decision-making. When combined with ancillary environmental or species data, this fundamental species population information directly underpins a range of biodiversity and ecosystem function indicators. The unified concept we present links disparate data to downstream uses and informs a vision for species population monitoring in which data collection is closely integrated with models and infrastructure to support effective biodiversity assessment.},

Given the urgency of climate change and the loss of habitat, it is vital that we use new technologies to improve and expand global biodiversity monitoring to thousands of sites around the world. In this article, we describe the acoustical component of the Automated Remote BiodiversityMonitoring Network (ARBIMON), a novel combination of hardware and software for automating data acquisition, data management, and species identification based on audio recordings. The major components of the cyberinfrastructure include: a solar powered remote monitoring station that sends 1-min recordings every 10 min to a base station, which relays the recordings in real-time to the project server, where the recordings are processed and uploaded to the project website (arbimon.net). Along with a module for viewing, listening, and annotating recordings, the website includes a species identification interface to help users create machine learning algorithms to automate species identification. To demonstrate the system we present data on the vocal activity patterns of birds, frogs, insects, and mammals from Puerto Rico and Costa Rica. {\textcopyright} 2013 Aide et al.},

abstract = {Optim provides a range of optimization capabilities written in the Julia programming language (Bezanson et al. 2017). Our aim is to enable researchers, users, and other Julia packages to solve optimization problems without writing such algorithms themselves. The package supports optimization on manifolds, functions of complex numbers, and input types such as arbitrary precision vectors and matrices. We have implemented routines for derivative free, first-order, and second-order optimization methods. The user can provide derivatives themselves, or request that they are calculated using automatic differentiation or finite difference methods. The main focus of the package has currently been on unconstrained optimization, however, box-constrained optimization is supported, and a more comprehensive support for constraints is underway. Similar to Optim, the C library NLopt (Johnson 2008) contains a collection of nonlinear optimization routines. In Python, scipy.optimize supports many of the same algorithms as Optim does, and Pymanopt (Townsend, Niklas, and Weichwald 2016) is a toolbox for manifold optimization. Within the Julia community, the packages BlackBoxOptim.jl and Optimize.jl provide optimization capabilities focusing on derivative-free and large-scale smooth problems respectively. The packages Convex.jl and JuMP.jl (Dunning, Huchette, and Lubin 2017) define modelling languages for which users can formulate optimization problems. In contrast to the previously mentioned optimization codes, Convex and JuMP work as abstraction layers between the user and solvers from a other packages. Optimization routines As of version 0.14, the following optimization routines are available. • Second-order methods – Newton – Newton with trust region – Hessian-vector with trust region • First-order methods – BFGS – L-BFGS (with linear preconditioning) – Conjugate gradient (with linear preconditioning) – Gradient descent (with linear preconditioning) • Acceleration methods – Nonlinear GMRES – Objective acceleration • Derivative-free methods – Nelder–Mead – Simulated annealing – Particle swarm • Interval bound univariate methods Mogensen et al., (2018). Optim: A mathematical optimization package for Julia. Journal of Open Source Software, 3(24), 615. https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.00615 1 – Brent's method – Golden-section search The derivative based methods use line searches to assist convergence. Multiple line search algorithms are available, including interpolating backtracking and methods that aim to satisfy the Wolfe conditions. The optimization routines in this package have been used in both industrial and academic contexts. For example, parts of the internal work in the company Ternary Intelligence Inc. (Paramonov 2017) rely on the package. Notably, an upcoming book on optimization (Kochenderfer and Wheeler Forthcoming, 2018) uses Optim for its examples. Optim has been used for a wide range of applications in academic research, including optimal con-trol (Riseth, Dewynne, and Farmer 2017; Riseth 2017a), parameter estimation (Riseth and Taylor-King 2017; Rackauckas and Nie 2017; and Dony, He, and Stumpf 2018), quan-tum physics (Damle, Levitt, and Lin 2018), crystalline modelling (Chen and Ortner 2017; Braun, Buze, and Ortner 2017), and the large-scale astronomical cataloguing project Ce-leste (Regier et al. 2015; Regier et al. 2016). A new acceleration scheme for optimization (Riseth 2017b), and a preconditioning scheme for geometry optimisation (Packwood et al. 2016) have also been tested within the Optim framework.},
