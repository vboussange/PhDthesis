\section{Contributions}
The goal of this thesis was to provide a better understanding on xxx, and to give new insights into xxx. In particular, this thesis contributed to a better understanding of (i) , (ii) and (iii).

\subsection{Interplay between spatial structure and eco-evolutionary mechanisms}

\subsection{Blending ML and mechanistic models to learn from data}

\subsection{Quantitative support for eco-evolutionary processes in economic systems}

\subsection{Novel methods for the modelling of complex adaptive systems}


\section{Limitations}

\subsection{Limitation of PDE methods}
\cite{Akesson2021} : PDE methods are probably not as adapted as trait based ODEs. Those simpler models can already address important questions regarding climate change.
\cite{Tacchella2018}: In many cases, not only in economics, theoretical modelling and forecasting are not tightly related5
. Most of the modelling efforts are
in the direction of oversimplified representations that aim only at understanding the potential effects of a single variable, or of a lim- ited set of them, in a controlled setting

\section{Conclusion}
In light of the results, XXX.
% 
We expect XXX.

%%
Consequently, this thesis contributed to a better understanding of XXX.
% 
While recent studies have underlined the need to account for XXX, we XX.

\section{Perspectives}

\subsection{Toward a continuum between ML and mechanistic models}

\subsection{Evolutionary biology to undertsand the economic patterns}
