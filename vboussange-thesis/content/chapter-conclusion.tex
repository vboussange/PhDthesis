\subsection{Limitation of PDE methods}
\cite{Akesson2021} : PDE methods are probably not as adapted as trait based ODEs. Those simpler models can already address important questions regarding climate change.
\cite{Tacchella2018}: In many cases, not only in economics, theoretical modelling and forecasting are not tightly related5
. Most of the modelling efforts are
in the direction of oversimplified representations that aim only at understanding the potential effects of a single variable, or of a lim- ited set of them, in a controlled setting
