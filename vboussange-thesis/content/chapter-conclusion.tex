\section{Contributions}
The study of biological and economic systems is a study of the ecological and evolutionary processes, and the resulting mechanisms, that act at different levels of organization and result in cohesive dynamics \cite{Levin2002}.
% 
Key challenges are to disentangle the necessary and sufficient elemental processes, and understand their couplings. 

Adressing those challenges, my work aimed at advancing our quantitative understanding of how ecological and evolutionary processes, and their interplay, shape the dynamics of biological and economic systems. In particular, this thesis contributed to 
% 
\begin{mylisti}
    \item methodological advances in the forward and inverse modelling of eco-evolutionary dynamics in biological and economic systems \cref{chap1,chap2,chap4},
    \item a fundamental undersanding of the role of eco-evolutionary processes in shaping the dynamics of biological populations structured in complex landscapes \cite{chap1},
    \item the quantification of the effect of eco-evolutionary processes in economic systems \cref{chap3}.
\end{mylisti}

In the following, I discuss the chapters of my thesis collectively within the broader context of our fundamental understanding and the modelling paradigm of the dynamics of biological and economic systems.

% \subsection{Limitation of PDE methods}
% \cite{Akesson2021} : PDE methods are probably not as adapted as trait based ODEs. Those simpler models can already address important questions regarding climate change.
% \cite{Tacchella2018}: In many cases, not only in economics, theoretical modelling and forecasting are not tightly related5

% \subsubsection*{An urgent need for better understanding and model eco-evolutionary dynamics}
% The effect of direct anthropogenic pressure, together with climate change, is rapidly affecting ecosystems \cite{Ellis2011,Midgley2019}. Ecosystems are approaching state shifts \cite{Barnosky2011,Barnosky2012,Midgley2019}, which in turn will greatly affect human societies \cite{Mooney2009}.
% %
% %% Constatation of system state shift
% % Current extinction rates are higher than would be expected from the fossil record \cite{Barnosky2011}. %Based on habitat models, \cite{Midgley2019} predicts, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15\% to 37\% of species would be committed to extinction. 
% % 
% %%
% While there is a general agreement that anthropogenic pressure and climate change will have a negative effect on the biosphere \cite{fischlin2007ecosystems}, their precise effect on ecosytem dynamics is unclear \cite{Norberg2012}. In particular, the answer to how species will adapt to increasing temperatures is uncertain due to our lack of understanding of eco-evolutionary feedbacks \cite{Norberg2012}. 
% % 
% %For instance, with global warming, species are likey to shift towards higher elevations and higher latitudes \cite{Chen2011}. Because the speed of range shifts differ between different ecological groups, climate change is expected to modify the current organization of trophic interactions \cite{Descombes2020}, affecting ecosystem functioning.
% %
% %% 
% Current projections of ecosystem states, such as \cite{Midgley2019},
% are based on habitat models, where species habitats are deducted from species occurence data, and are reprojected it given environmental predictors.
% % 
% Such approaches miss the processes of ecological interactions, evolutionary change and species dispersal \cite{Pearson2003}, that are expected to play a critical role in the evolution of the biosphere in the coming decades \cite{Norberg2012}.
% % 
% In order to mitigate the consequences of human development, it is of utmost urgency to better understand eco-evolutionary feedbacks \cite{Norberg2012}, and develop mechanistic models embedding this knowledge \cite{Urban2016}. This will in turn provide more reliable forecasts of ecosystem states \cite{Clark2001}, to help designing adequate management of ecosystem services \cite{Urban2016}.
