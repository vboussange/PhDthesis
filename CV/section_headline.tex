I am a researcher with interest in complex systems, mathematical modeling and scientific machine learning.
My Ph.D aims at better understanding the drivers behind diversification processes in biological and economic systems. I conduct my investigations with mathematical models capturing eco-evolutionary dynamics. In parallel, I develop machine learning methods to empower these models and obtain an agreement with empirical data. I believe that the combination of mechanistic models and machine learning provides a powerful approach to better understand and forecast the dynamics of real ecosystems and economies. This is crucial for policy-makers to take the right decisions, in the face of potentially important ecosystem changes and accelerating threats.}
